## [0.13.0] 2020-07-08

- Upgrading `@stream-io/react-native-simple-markdown` to 1.2.0. It fixes markdown related issues regarding line breaks
- Added a new prop to the MessageInput component - `sendImageAsync`. Itâ€™s value defaults to false, but when set to true, if the user hits send on a message before an attached image has finished uploading, the message text will be sent immediately and the image will be sent as a follow-up message as soon as a successful response has been received by the CDN [455571d](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/455571d68db5e617882b59a81e15f934f0365952)

## [0.12.1] 2020-06-16

- Allow search for special characters in mentions autocomplete [a2cb083](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/a2cb083a3d6657b5c3a122fcd5843d0c9f51a5a6)

## [0.12.0] 2020-06-15

- **Improvements to autocomplete feature in MessageInput component**.

Until now if your channel had more than 100 members, then you couldn't see members (besides first 100) in mentions popup box. This was because queryChannels api only populates 100 members in channel state and mentions feature was based on searching for members in channel state.

From now on, autocomplete input (specifically mentions autocomplete) will be api based search. So that mentions feature will work even for the channels with more than 100 members.

## [0.11.0] 2020-06-01

**Non breaking changes**

### UX improvements of ChannelList component

  <div style="display: inline">
    <img src="./screenshots/7.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="250" border="1" style="margin-right: 30px" />
    <img src="./screenshots/8.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="250" border="1" style="margin-right: 30px" />
    <img src="./screenshots/9.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="250" border="1" />
  </div>

  - So far we only had `LoadingErrorIndicator` (which can be customized using prop `LoadingErrorIndicator`). This error indicator replaces the entire channel
  list on screen. So if your 2nd page of list results in error, we used to remove all the already fetched channels and show this full screen error indicator.
  Instead we have introduced following error indicators, which will be displayed at top of the list in case or error. Please note that if first page of
  queryChannels api results in error, we will display LoadingErrorIndicator

    - HeaderErrorIndicator
    - HeaderNetworkDownIndicator

  - Introducing following new props to ChannelList component

    - `FooterLoadingIndicator` {UI Component} To override default spinner at footer of channel list (introduced in this release)
    - `HeaderErrorIndicator` {UI Component} To override default HeaderErrorIndicator
    - `HeaderNetworkDownIndicator`{UI Component} To override default HeaderNetworkDownIndicator

  - Introduced pull to refresh functionality, to refresh the ChannelList in case of failure.
  - Adding following prop to `LoadingErrorIndicator`

    - `retry` {func} If you are using custom `LoadingErrorIndicator` for your ChannelList component, you can attach this function to CTA button
    to reload the ChannelList.

  - Added retry mechanism to ChannelList's queryChannels api call. In case of failure, api will be retried 3 times (max) at the interval of 2 seconds.

### Prop changes to components (non-breaking)

- MessageSimple

  **new props**

  - `MessageReplies` UI component to override default `2 replies` text/component
  - `MessageHeader` UI component to add some content on top of message content (text, attachments)
  - `ReactionList` UI component to override default ReactionList component
  - `supportedReactions` Array of reactions which should be available or supported in reaction picker. [Example](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/vishal/docs-improvement/docs/cookbook.md#message-with-custom-reactions)

  **deprecated props**

  - `emojiDate` Please use supportedReactions instead

- MessageAvatar

  **new props**

  - `alignment` ('right' | 'left')

- MessageContent

  **new props**

  - All the new props to MessageSimple are available in MessageContent
  - `alignment` ('right' | 'left')

- ReactionPickerWrapper

  In previous version, you could open reaction picker only after clicking/pressing `ReactionList`, which made it hard to change the
  functionality of `ReactionList` without copy pasting lots of code regarding opening of `ReactionPicker`. And also ReactionPicker
  logic was tightly coupled with MessageContent component (which meant added complexity)
  With ReactionPickerWrapper, we are taking out all the ReactionPicker related logic (setting the position of reaction picker
  at message which was touched) from MessageContent. So you can now add _open reaction picker on press_ functionality
  on any component that you wish. You just need to wrap your component with `ReactionPickerWrapper` component.

  You can also adjust the relative position at which ReactionPicker opens up or shows up by altering `offset`
  prop on ReactionPickerWrapper.

  Default value is:

  ```
  {
      top: 40,
      left: 30,
      right: 10,
  }
  ```

  NOTE: This component was present in repository in previous versions as well, but it was super buggy.

  **TL;DR** Enables you to build custom ReactionList, on touch of which, ReactionPicker will open up

  Please check this example from cookbook for details - https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/vishal/docs-improvement/docs/cookbook.md#message-bubble-with-reactions-at-bottom-of-message
