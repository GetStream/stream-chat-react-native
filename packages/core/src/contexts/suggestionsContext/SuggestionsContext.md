The MessageInput component supports a suggestions feature. Suggestions are displayed using a popup which contains a list of the suggestion items. All functionality is saved in the SuggestionsContext and can be accessed through the [SuggestionsProvider](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/master/src/contexts/suggestionsContext/SuggestionsContext.tsx) higher order component.

  - **component:** UI component used to display each item in the suggestions list
- **setInputBoxContainerRef** {function} Sets a ref on the text input box container
- **updateSuggestions** {function} Updates the suggestions in the suggestions popup
