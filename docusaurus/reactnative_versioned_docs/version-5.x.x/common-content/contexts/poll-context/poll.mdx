An instance of the [`Poll` class](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/poll.ts) containing reactive state.

It is used by the underlying `usePollContext`, `usePollStateStore` and `usePollState` hooks to provide us with the reactive `Poll` state.

:::note

If you need the `Poll` instance you may get it from `client.polls.fromState(pollId)`.
