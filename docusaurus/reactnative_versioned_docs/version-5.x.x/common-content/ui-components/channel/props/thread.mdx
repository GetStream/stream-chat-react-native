Can be either a `MessageType` object or a [`ThreadType`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/develop/package/src/contexts/threadContext/ThreadContext.tsx) that when set indicates a thread is open.
Both of the types may be used interchangeably.

When used with the [`Thread`](../../../../ui-components/thread.mdx) component this will display the thread.
When used with the standard [`MessageList`](../../../../ui-components/message-list.mdx) component this will prevent any singleton components in the [`OverlayProvider`](../../../../core-components/overlay-provider.mdx) form getting out of sync.

:::note

`thread` should be set on all `Channel` components when a thread is open.
