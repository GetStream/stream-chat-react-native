The core of Stream Chat for React Native is it's ability to be customized to your needs.
The new `Global Config` feature allows you to enable and disable features of the library and alter the default behavior of the SDK.

:::info
This will be not be the recommended way of setting the config in the next major version of the SDK that is v6.

Use the `resizableCDNHosts` prop in the [`Chat`](../core-components/chat.mdx) component instead.

import { StreamChatRN } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

StreamChatRN.setConfig({
  resizableCDNHosts: ['https://my-company-cdn.com'],
  // future config options
});
```
