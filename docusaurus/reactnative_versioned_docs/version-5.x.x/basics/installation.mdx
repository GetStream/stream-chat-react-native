Installation and usage of our Stream Chat React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native. You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

For Expo, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

### Add Stream's Chat SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Chat React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  groupId='rn-platform'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add stream-chat-react-native
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx expo install stream-chat-expo
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Stream Chat React Native SDK requires installing some peer dependencies to provide you with a great chat experience. You can run the following command to install them:

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  groupId='rn-platform'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add @react-native-community/netinfo @stream-io/flat-list-mvcp react-native-fs react-native-gesture-handler react-native-image-resizer react-native-reanimated react-native-svg
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx expo install @stream-io/flat-list-mvcp @react-native-community/netinfo expo-file-system expo-image-manipulator react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-svg
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

So what did we install precisely?

<Tabs
defaultValue='rncli'
groupId='rn-platform'
values={[
  { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
  { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
]}

<TabItem value='rncli'>

### Optional Dependencies

:::note
Starting from `v5.35.0` the `react-native-image-crop-picker` and `expo-image-picker` is no longer a required dependency. You can use it if you want to capture images to attach them in the message else feel free to uninstall it.
:::

There are a few optional dependencies that can be added to have more features within the SDK.

:::note
Please follow along the linked documentation of each optional dependencies so as to support them correctly in your application.

### Configuring permissions

Some dependencies(if you are using them on your application), require you to add additional permissions to the `Info.plist` file in iOS and `AndroidManifest.xml` file in Android. Please follow the steps mentioned in the links below for corresponding dependencies:

<Tabs
defaultValue='rncli'
groupId='rn-platform'
values={[
  { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
  { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

- [`@react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll`](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll?tab=readme-ov-file#permissions) for gallery/photo library access.
- [`react-native-image-crop-picker`](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker?tab=readme-ov-file#step-3) for camera access.
- [`react-native-audio-recorder-player`](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-audio-recorder-player?tab=readme-ov-file#post-installation) for microphone access for voice recording.

An example `AndroidManifest.xml` would look like this with permissions:

```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
    android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

An example `Info.plist` would look like this with permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like access to your photo gallery to share image in a message.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to save photos to your photo gallery after downloading from a message.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to use your camera to share image in a message.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to use your microphone for voice recording.</string>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expo">

- [`expo-media-library`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#configurable-properties) for gallery/photo library access.
- [`expo-image-picker`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker/#configuration-in-appjsonappconfigjs) for camera access.
- [`expo-av`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/av/#configuration-in-appjsonappconfigjs) for microphone access for voice recording.

An example `app.json` config for expo would look like this to add permissions to the `Info.plist` on iOS, using the config plugins:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-media-library",
        {
          "photosPermission": "$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like access to your photo gallery to share image in a message.",
          "savePhotosPermission": "$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to save photos to your photo gallery after downloading from a message."
        }
      ],
      [
        "expo-image-picker",
        {
          "cameraPermission": "$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to use your camera to share image in a message."
        }
      ],
      [
        "expo-av",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to use your microphone for voice recording."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

For Android on Expo, most of the most permissions are added automatically by libraries that you use in your app either with config plugins or with a package-level `AndroidManifest.xml`. Read more [here](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/permissions/#android).

### Additional Steps

Some dependencies require us to make changes to our application for all functionalities to be available.

The most important steps to get started are:

- Add the Babel plugin for [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#installation#babel-plugin) to your `babel.config.js` file in your application folder:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ... // don't add it here :)
  ],
  plugins: [
    ...
    // highlight-next-line
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
  ],
};
```

:::caution
`react-native-reanimated/plugin` has to be listed last.
:::

- After installation, wrap your entry point with `<GestureHandlerRootView>` or `gestureHandlerRootHOC`:

```js
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

export default function App() {
  return <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>{/* content */}</GestureHandlerRootView>;
}
```

:::note
The entry point of your app exists usually either in `index.js` or `App.tsx` file. In case of navigation with Expo Router v3.x, the entry point is inside `app/_layout.js`.
:::

Please also follow the steps mentioned in the links below for corresponding dependencies:

- `react-native` - [additional installation steps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#gif-and-webp-support-on-android)
- `react-native-image-crop-picker` - [additional installation steps](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker#step-3)
- `@react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll` - [additional installation steps](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll#permissions)

Now you should be able to run the app on simulator by running following command:

<Tabs
defaultValue='rncli'
groupId='rn-platform'
values={[
  { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
  { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
]}
>
<TabItem value="rncli">
<Tabs
defaultValue='android'
values={[
  { label: 'Android', value: 'android' },
  { label: 'iOS', value: 'iOS' },
]}
>

<TabItem value="iOS">

```bash title="Terminal"
npx pod-install
yarn ios
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android">

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn android
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expo">
<Tabs
