title: usePollOptionVotesPagination
---

A hook that queries votes for a given option in a `Poll` and returns them in a paginated fashion. It can be used whenever we want to view all votes for an option in a given `poll`, like in the [`PollOptionFullResults` component](../../ui-components/poll-option-full-results.mdx) for example.

## Properties

### `loadFirstPage`

A property that depicts whether the hook should load the first page of answers when first invoked or not. Default to `true` if omitted.

### `option` \*

The `poll` option that we want to query the votes for.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| `object` |

### `paginationParams`

An object containing the pagination parameters that we may want to pass to the hook that will then be used to query for votes.

Its type can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts) under the name `PollOptionVotesQueryParams`.

The `{ option_id: <option-id> }` filter is mandatory and will be added regardless of overrides.
