Stream Chat for React Native provides many features out of the box that require positioning on the screen in a certain manor to result in the desired UI.
The `AttachmentPicker`, `ImageGallery`, and `MessageOverlay`, all need to be rendered in front of other components to have the desired effect.
All of these elements are controlled by the `OverlayProvider`, when used together with navigation considerations need to be taken in how these will appear.

The guidance provided makes the assumption you are using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) in your app in conjunction with [`createStackNavigator`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/).

:::note

**If you are using another navigation solution, or utilizing [`createNativeStackNavigator`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/), other considerations will need to be taken depending on your navigation arrangement.**

<br />

<code>createNativeStackNavigator</code> uses the native APIs <code>UINavigationController</code> on iOS and <code>
  Fragment
</code> on Android. The <code>OverlayProvider</code> needs to exist in a view that can render content in front of the chat
screen. Therefore using a <code>fullScreenModal</code> with <code>createNativeStackNavigator</code>, which uses <code>
  UIModalPresentationFullScreen
</code> on iOS and <code>modal</code> on Android, to render your chat screen will leave the <code>
  OverlayProvider
</code> rendered behind the chat. If you are having issues we suggest you get in touch with support and we can find a
solution to your specific navigation arrangement.

## Navigation Container

The [`NavigationContainer`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container/) manages the apps state in React Navigation.
Nested navigators and screens all exist within the container.
To ensure the `OverlayProvider` can render content above all of these screens, headers, tab-bars, etc. the `OverlayProvider` must be rendered around them.

[As noted in Hello Stream Chat](./hello_stream_chat.mdx#chat) the `Chat` component can either surround the entire application or be rendered locally on a screen.
You can choose whatever suits your needs best, theming, connection handling, and translations are all handled out of the box in the `Chat` component; and this may be a consideration in where in the app you want this component to be rendered.

:::note

Having it higher in the _stack_ helps to ensure it is not unmounted at times when a connection is present.
If `Chat` is unmounted with a connection present you may have to implement some connection handling functions yourself to ensure you reconnect when the app is, for instance, reopened from the background.
The WebSocket connection closes on it's own approximately 15 seconds after the app is backgrounded.
Not handling the connection on [`appState`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate) changes will also effect [how Stream Chat handles Push Notifications](../guides/push_notifications_v2.mdx).

      </Stack.Navigator>
    </OverlayProvider>
  </NavigationContainer>
);
```

## Keyboard

The `Channel` component contains a <!-- TODO: Change to new docs for links -->`KeyboardCompatibleView` that, like [the standard React Native `KeyboardAvoidingView`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview), needs a `keyboardVerticalOffset` to account for distance between the top of the user screen and the react native view.
This height in most cases with React Navigation in conjunction with Stream Chat is the header height of React Navigation.
This can be accessed from React Navigation using the `useHeaderHeight` hook from `@react-navigation/stack`, and given as a prop to `Channel`.

```tsx
  const headerHeight = useHeaderHeight();

  <Channel keyboardVerticalOffset={headerHeight}>
```

## Attachment Picker

The `AttachmentPicker` is a keyboard-esk view that allows a user to attach photos and files.
Part of the construction of the `AttachmentPicker` is a bottom-sheet provided by the `OverlayProvider`.
This bottom-sheet provides a grid of images in a scrollable list that can be lifted up to make selecting images easier.
The placement of the `AttachmentPicker` is dependant on two values, the `bottomInset` and the `topInset`.

### Top Inset

`topInset` is used to determine how high the scrollable bottom-sheet can go when opened.
`topInset` defaults to 0 and covers the entire screen, or it can be set to the [top safe area inset](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/handling-safe-area/#use-the-hook-for-more-control) if desired.
The most common choice when using React Navigation is to get the header height using the `useHeaderHeight` hook from `@react-navigation/stack` and set the top inset to the given height for a nice visual result where the picker open to the header.

```tsx
const headerHeight = useHeaderHeight();
const { setTopInset } = useAttachmentPickerContext();

useEffect(() => {
  setTopInset(headerHeight);
}, [headerHeight]);
```

:::note

`topInset` can be set via props on the `OverlayProvider`, or set via the `setTopInset` function provided by the `useAttachmentPickerContext` hook.

:::

### Bottom Inset

`bottomInset` is used to adjust the height of the `AttachmentPicker` menu to align properly with the bottom-sheet when open.
This is the height between the bottom of the <!-- TODO: Change to new docs for links -->`MessageInput` container and the bottom of the screen.
If you are displaying the chat screen without a tab-bar it is most likely the bottom inset is the [bottom safe area inset](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/handling-safe-area/#use-the-hook-for-more-control).
If you are using a bottom tab-bar you can utilize the `useBottomTabBarHeight` hook from `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` to get the appropriate height to use.

```tsx {11,15}
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
import { Chat, OverlayProvider } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const client = StreamChat.getInstance('api_key');
const Stack = createStackNavigator<{ home: undefined }>();

export const Nav = () => {
  const { bottom } = useSafeAreaInsets();

  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <OverlayProvider bottomInset={bottom}>
        <Chat client={client}>
          <Stack.Navigator>
            <Stack.Screen component={() => {/** App components */})} name='home' />
          </Stack.Navigator>
        </Chat>
      </OverlayProvider>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};
```

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
import { Nav } from './Nav';

export const App = () => (
  <SafeAreaProvider>
    <Nav />
  </SafeAreaProvider>
);
```

:::note

`bottomInset` can be set via props on the `OverlayProvider`, or set via the `setBottomInset` function provided by the `useAttachmentPickerContext` hook.

:::

### Resetting Selected Images

The selected images in the `AttachmentPicker` are tightly coupled to the `MessageInput`.
As there is only one `AttachmentPicker` in the navigation stack, but multiple `MessageInput`'s can exist, there are details around the setup that must be implemented correctly.
For the typical navigation setup clearing the selected images is handled out of the box.
For this to function properly your usage of the `Channel` component must include the usage of `thread` when appropriate.
Failing to do this will result in unintentional behavior, such as excess image uploads as the selected images will be uploaded twice when selected if the `thread` state is not properly kept.

In more complex scenarios where more than one `Channel` could potentially be rendered in multiple tabs a different approach would be necessary.
It is suggested that you architect an approach best for your specific scenario.

The `setSelectedImages` function can be pulled off of the `useAttachmentPickerContext` for granular control of the `AttachmentPicker` images.

## Image Gallery

The `ImageGallery` is populated by the <!-- TODO: Change to new docs for links -->`MessageList` component.
`MessageList` utilizes information provided by both the `ThreadContext` and `threadList` prop to determine if the `ImageGallery` should be updated.
If there is both a `thread` provided by the `ThreadContext` and the `threadList` prop is `true` on `MessageList`, or both values are falsy, the `ImageGallery` is updated appropriately.

In practice this means that if you implement a screen for the main `Channel`, and another for `Thread` that is navigated to `onThreadSelect`, you need to indicate to the main `Channel` it should not update the `ImageGallery` while the `Thread` screen is present.
To do this the main `Channel` component should be given the appropriate `thread` when the `Thread` screen shown, then the `thread` removed when navigating back to the main `Channel` screen.

This can be done by keeping the current `thread` in a `context` and setting it `onThreadSelect`, then removing it `onThreadDismount`.
Alternatively if a user only has a single path to and from the `Channel` screen to the `Thread` screen and back you can accomplish the same result using a local state and the [`useFocusEffect`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-focus-effect/) hook from React Navigation.
