React Native Chat SDK package follows a [semantic versioning (`semver`)](https://semver.org/) since v4.0.0.

That means that with a version number x.y.z (major.minor.patch):

- When releasing bug fixes (backwards compatible), we make a patch release by changing the z number (ex: 4.1.0 to 4.1.1). A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.
- When releasing new features or non-critical fixes, we make a minor release by changing the y number (ex: 4.1.0 to 4.2.0).
- When releasing breaking changes (backward incompatible), we make a major release by changing the x number (ex: 4.1.0 to 5.0.0).

Please check the official [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/#summary) docs for more information. This versioning policy does not apply to prerelease packages (below major version of 1)
Whenever possible, we will add deprecation warnings in preparation for future breaking changes.
