Enables/disables the legacy image viewer behavior.

When true, within the image viewer you can keep swiping left to scroll through all the images that have been loaded within a channel so far.
Be aware that this creates quite a lot of extra work for the JS thread to keep track of image attachments loaded in a channel and pre-populating them in the viewer for smooth transitions.
