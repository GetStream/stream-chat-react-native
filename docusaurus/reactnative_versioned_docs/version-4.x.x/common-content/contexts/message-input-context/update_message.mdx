This function is a counterpart of [`sendMessage`](#sendmessage), for the case of editing a message. This function is attached to [`SendButton`](../../../core-components/channel.mdx#sendbutton) when some existing message is being updated.
Similar to `sendMessage` function, the message will be updated in message list UI first, before making api call to update the message.
