`ThemeContext` is provided by [`OverlayProvider`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx) and [`Chat`](../core-components/chat.mdx) components.
Read the [theming section](../customization/theming.mdx) for more information on how to customize your theme.
If you are not familiar with React Context API, please read about it on [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Basic Usage

`ThemeContext` can be consumed by any of the child component of `OverlayProvider` or `Chat` components.

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const {
  theme: {
    colors: { accent_red },
  },
} = useContext(OverlayContext);
```

Alternatively, you can also use `useTheme` hook provided by library to consume ThemeContext.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const {
  theme: {
    colors: { accent_red },
  },
} = useTheme();
```

## Value

### theme

The default theme object in [theme.ts](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/master/package/src/contexts/themeContext/utils/theme.ts)
merged with the theme you pass as `style` to [`OverlayProvider`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx) or [`Chat`](../core-components/chat.mdx) components.
