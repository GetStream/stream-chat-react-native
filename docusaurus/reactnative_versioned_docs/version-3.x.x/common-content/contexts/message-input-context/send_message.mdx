Sends a composed message within `MessageInput` component to channel. This function is attached to `onPress` handler of [`SendButton`](../../../core-components/channel.mdx#sendbutton). The message optimistically gets added to message list UI first, before actually making API call to server.
During this intermediate stage, MessageStatus component will display an indicator for "pending" state.
