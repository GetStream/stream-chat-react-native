Filter object passed internally to the [client query function](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/query_channels/?language=javascript) as a parameter.
You can filter a query on [built-in](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/query_channels/?language=javascript#common-filters-by-use-case) and custom fields on a Channel.

#### Example

Filter to query channels which users `vishal` or `jaap` are members of.

```tsx
const filter = {
  type: 'messaging',
  members: {
    $in: ['vishal', 'jaap']
  },
};
```

:::note

For optimal performance you should pass a filter object with a static reference.
You can use a filter object that is not created inline; or memoize an inline filter object before passing it to the `ChannelList` to achieve this.
