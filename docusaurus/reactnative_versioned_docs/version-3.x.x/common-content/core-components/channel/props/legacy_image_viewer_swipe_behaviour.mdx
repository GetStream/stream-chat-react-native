Enables/disables the legacy image viewer behavior.

By default, when you open (press) an image attachment it opens the image in a full-screen image viewer.
Within the viewer, you can keep swiping left to scroll through all the images that have been loaded within a channel so far.
This creates quite a lot of extra work for the JS thread to keep track of image attachments loaded in a channel and pre-populating them in the viewer for smooth transitions.

For performance reason, you can switch to an alternate UX for the image viewer where image attachments are only loaded for the selected messages in a viewer,
by setting this prop to false.
