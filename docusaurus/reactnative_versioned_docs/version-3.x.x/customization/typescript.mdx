`stream-chat-react-native` as well as the client library `stream-chat-js` are written in TypeScript and therefore provide full TypeScript types and support.

Stream Chat allows for a variety of customizations including custom fields on messages, channels, users, and more.
The goal of the Stream Chat TypeScript implementation is to provide static type safety not just on the out of the box Stream Chat implementation, but on custom data provided to the API & SDK as well.

## Generics

[Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) allow users of the library to accurately represent custom data fields being used by providing typings that are passed to server responses, custom components, filters, etc.
In many cases TypeScript can use [inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html) from a provided prop to infer the generics used.

## Client

It is important that the proper generics be applied to the `stream-chat-js` client when it is instantiated.
The [documentation on `stream-chat-js` TypeScript](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js#typescript-v2xx) has examples of how this can be done in detail.
The client takes seven optional generics that correspond to the seven customizable fields that currently exist in `stream-chat-js`.

```tsx
const client = StreamChat.getInstance<
  AttachmentType,
  ChannelType,
  CommandType,
  EventType,
  MessageType,
  ReactionType,
  UserType
>('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

The seven customizable fields these generics extend are provided via `stream-chat-js`.

1. [`Attachment`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L1471)
2. [`ChannelResponse`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L173)
3. [`CommandVariants`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L1587)
4. [`Event`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L1000)
5. [`MessageBase`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L1764)
6. [`Reaction`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L1854)
7. [`User`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/0e29bea1e773f15599564b5174d4fabbd3bcb495/src/types.ts#L2004)

All seven generics contain defaults in the `stream-chat-react-native` repo that you can extend for custom data.

```tsx
type DefaultAttachmentType = Record<string, unknown> & {
  file_size?: number | string;
  mime_type?: string;
};
type DefaultChannelType = Record<string, unknown> & {
  image?: string;
};
type DefaultCommandType = string & {};
type DefaultEventType = Record<string, unknown>;
type DefaultMessageType = Record<string, unknown>;
type DefaultReactionType = Record<string, unknown>;
type DefaultUserType = Record<string, unknown> & {
  image?: string;
};
```

Additional fields on the defaults i.e. `file_size`, `mime_type`, and `image` are custom fields used by `stream-chat-react-native` already within the SDK.
When wanting to set a subset of generics the preceding and interceding generics must also be set in order for the TypeScript compiler to correctly understand intent.

To set `ChannelType` and `MessageType` for `AttachmentType`, `CommandType`, and `EventType` must also be set.

```tsx
const client = StreamChat.getInstance<
  DefaultAttachmentType,
  { image?: string; nickName?: string },
  DefaultCommandType,
  DefaultEventType,
  { isAdminMessage?: boolean }
>('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

:::note

`DefaultCommandType` is set to `string & {}` instead of `string` to maintain intellisense for the included commands.
In use a string union such as `'poll' | 'question'` could be used to extend them.

## JSX / TSX

The [TypeScript Example App](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/master/examples/TypeScriptMessaging/App.tsx) shows how to apply the generics to many of the components in the SDK.
Core to understanding this usage is [how generics can be applied to JSX elements](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-9.html#generic-type-arguments-in-jsx-elements).

In many cases the use of a single prop such as `client` or `channel` allows TypeScript to infer the generics on an element.
In this case `LocalAttachmentType` is inferred from `channel` and passed to the props type for a custom Attachment component.

<img src={inference} alt='TypeScript Inference' />

Not all components use or are always provided a prop that can provide inference though.
In these cases the generics must be applied to the component directly.
`MessageList` for instance could have the previous generics used on `client` applied to it in a similar manner.

```tsx
<MessageList<
  DefaultAttachmentType,
  { image?: string; nickName?: string },
  DefaultCommandType,
  DefaultEventType,
  { isAdminMessage?: boolean }
>
  onThreadSelect={thread => {
    /** Set thread and navigate to thread screen */
  }}
/>
```

This passes the generics through appropriately to custom components and other props, in this case the custom `Message` component would receive the generics.

## Hooks

Hooks, including those to access contexts, also require generics to be applied to correctly type custom returns.
`useChannelContext` for instance would have the previous generics applied to it to get a correctly typed return for `channel`.

```tsx
const { channel } = useChannelContext<
  DefaultAttachmentType,
  { image?: string; nickName?: string },
  DefaultCommandType,
  DefaultEventType,
  { isAdminMessage?: boolean }
>();
```

## Partial inference

Inference only works correctly when all generics are provided by a given input.
[Partial Type Argument Inference](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/26242) is currently not supported in TypeScript.

### Higher Order Components

The lack of partial inference is particularly relevant if Higher Order Components (HOC) are used in place of the provided context hooks.
The `withChannelContext` HOC accepts the generics similarly to the `useChannelContext` hook, but because partial inference is not supported the props for the wrapped component must also be explicitly provided.

```tsx {2}
withChannelContext<
  MyComponentProps,
  DefaultAttachmentType,
  { image?: string; nickName?: string },
  DefaultCommandType,
  DefaultEventType,
  { isAdminMessage?: boolean }
>(MyComponent);
```
