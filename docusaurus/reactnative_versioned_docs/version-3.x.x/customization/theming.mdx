The majority of components used in `stream-chat-react-native` can have custom styles applied to them via the theming system.

## Creating a theme

To accurately create a theme we suggest utilizing our exported types to create your own theme.
This will allow you to ensure the keys you are using in your theme object are correct.

When you provide a theme as a prop a deep merge of the theme and default theme is performed so only styles designated in the custom theme overwrite the defaults.
We provide a helper type `DeepPartial` that makes all of the keys at every depth optional, this is to account for the deep merge that is performed.

You can find the default theme object in [theme.ts](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/main/package/src/contexts/themeContext/utils/theme.ts).

```tsx
import type { DeepPartial, Theme } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const theme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
  messageSimple: {
    file: {
      container: {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Applying a theme

There are two entry points for custom themes into the SDK, in the `OverlayProvider` and `Chat` components.
`Chat` takes a prop `style` which accepts a custom theme.
The `OverlayProvider` accepts the same `style` as a key on the prop `value`.

In practice you only need to provide you custom theme to the `OverlayProvider` as the theme is accessed via context.
Nested `ThemeProvider` components merge themes provided by higher level `ThemeProvider` components, so the theme provided to the `OverlayProvider` will be available from the `ThemeProvider` in the `Chat` component.
This allows you to provide a different theme at different levels of the application if you choose.

```tsx {2}
export const App = () => (
  <OverlayProvider value={{ style: theme }}>
    <Chat client={client}>
      <ChannelList />
    </Chat>
  </OverlayProvider>
);
```

## Dark mode

If you would like to support dark mode in your application you can create and apply different themes depending on the current `colorScheme` provided by React Native.
To prevent unnecessary deep merges and re-renders we suggest keeping the current theme in state and only change it when theme colorScheme changes.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';
import type { DeepPartial, Theme } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

export const App = () => {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const getTheme = (): DeepPartial<Theme> => ({
    colors: colorScheme === 'dark' ? { black: '#FFFFFF' } : { black: '#000000' },
  });
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(getTheme());

  useEffect(() => {
    setTheme(getTheme());
  }, [colorScheme]);

  return (
    <OverlayProvider value={{ style: theme }}>
      <Chat client={client}>
        <ChannelList />
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};
```

## Using the theme

You can easily access the theme in any custom components you create using the `useTheme` hook.
To ensure any change to the theme is reflected within the UI it is not advised to pass theme variables through custom memoization checks.

```tsx
const {
  theme: {
    colors: { black },
  },
} = useTheme();
```

## Identifying theme paths

Where possible we have used `displayName` on components to expose the theme path to the style.
To view the `displayName` on a component.

- Open the [in-app developer menu](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu)
- Turn on inspector by pressing `Show Inspector` button
- Select the desired component and the `displayName` will be shown in the inspector path

Not all theme styles are tied to high level components; but we have added this debugging strategy to help in locating the most common components easily.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={inspector} alt='Inspector' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

To find the path and customize the style on a file attachment for instance we locate the component using the inspector.
The `displayName` is listed as `FileAttachment{messageSimple{file}}`.

This syntax is indicating the component is named `FileAttachment` and the style keys are `messageSimple` -> `file`.
There are often multiple keys on a designated display name corresponding to different sub-components styles.
In this case `file` has five sub-component keys that can modify the styling.

The exported types and original theme in [theme.ts](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/main/package/src/contexts/themeContext/utils/theme.ts) can then be referenced to create a custom modification to the theme.

```tsx
const theme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
  messageSimple: {
    file: {
      container: {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
      },
      icon: {
        height: 16,
        width: 16,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={unthemed} alt='Unthemed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
  <img src={themed} alt='Themed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

The resulting changes by applying the custom theme are easily seen in the change in icon size and background color of the file attachment.

:::note

Most of the styles are standard React Native styles, but some styles applying to SVGs, Markdown, or custom components are numbers, strings, or other specified types.
The TypeScript documentation of [`Theme`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/main/package/src/contexts/themeContext/utils/theme.ts) should help you in this regard.
Message text is an instance of an exception as it is rendered using [`react-native-markdown-package`](https://github.com/andangrd/react-native-markdown-package) and the [`MarkdownStyle`](https://github.com/andangrd/react-native-markdown-package/blob/main/styles.js) is added to the theme at key `messageSimple` -> `content` -> `markdown`.
