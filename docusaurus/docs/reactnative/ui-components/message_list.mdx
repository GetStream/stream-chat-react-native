---

`MessageList` component uses [`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) to render list of messages within a channel (provided as a prop to parent `Channel` component).
This component must be rendered within `Channel` component. It uses `message.type` property, to render corresponding view for message.

Additionally it also renders following building blocks for message list:

- `DateHeader` - which is a sticky header at top of the list and updates as you scroll up within list.
- `InlineDateSeparator` - which act as separators for messages from different dates
- `ScrollToBottomButton` - which when pressed, scrolls the list to most recent message.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
<OverlayProvider>
  <Chat client={client}>
    <Channel channel={channel}>
      <MessageList />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
</OverlayProvider>
```

## Props

### additionalFlatListProps

Set any additional props on underlying [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#props).

```jsx
const flatListProps = { bounces: true };

<MessageList additionalFlatListProps={flatListProps} />
```

:::caution

Don't use `additionalFlatListProps` to access the FlatList ref, use [`setFlatListRef`](#setflatlistref) instead.
