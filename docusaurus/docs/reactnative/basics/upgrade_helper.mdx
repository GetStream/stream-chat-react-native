## Update The Dependencies

Since v4, peer dependency `react-native-blur` has been removed from the SDK. Blur background of overlay has been
replaced with opacity based background instead. So unless this dependency is used explicitely within application, it
can be safely removed.

```sh
yarn remove react-native-blur
npx pod-install
```

## Whats new in v4?

### Optimized Image Attachments

[Gallery](../ui-components/gallery.mdx) component has been revamped to be more performant and more responsive.
Heavy images have been one of the crucial reasons previously for slow performance on low end devices. In this version of SDK,
we render resized version of images to avoid heavy load on memory.

Also previously all the image attachments used to be rendered in fixed size container, which was not ideal for portrait or landscape images since
user won't be able to see a cropped image on UI. In this version, we render images in dynamic size container, depending on aspect ratio of image.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='case1'
  values={[
    { label: 'Case 1', value: 'case1' },
    { label: 'Case 2', value: 'case2' },
    { label: 'Case 3', value: 'case3' },
  ]}

### Refactor Generics to a Single Generic

The Typescript generics can be simplified using a single Generic which can be passed to the component.

```tsx
const client = StreamChat.getInstance<StreamChatGenerics>('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

where `StreamChatGenerics` can be defined as;

```tsx
type StreamChatGenerics = {
  attachmentType: LocalAttachmentType;
  channelType: LocalChannelType;
  commandType: LocalCommandType;
  eventType: LocalEventType;
  messageType: LocalMessageType;
  reactionType: LocalReactionType;
  userType: LocalUserType;
};
```

:::note
`LocalAttachmentType`, `LocalChannelType` etc. are type deifinitions for their respective key as per your application types necessities.

Eg:

```tsx
type LocalAttachmentType = {
  file_size?: number;
  mime_type?: string;
};
type LocalChannelType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalCommandType = string;
type LocalEventType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalMessageType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalReactionType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalUserType = {
  image?: string;
};
```

:::

A seperate guide has been added to documentation for details of [Generics](../customization/typescript.mdx#generics)

### Slow Mode Feature

Slow mode helps reduce noise on a channel by limiting users to a maximum of 1 message per cooldown interval.
Slow mode is disabled by default and can be enabled/disabled via the Dashboard, using the Chat Explorer.

For more details, please check the documentation for [slow mode](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/slow_mode/?language=javascript#channel-slow-mode)

When cooldown interval kicks in, `SendButton` (to send message) will be replaced with a countdown timer
This countdown timer can be customized using a prop on Channel component - [`CooldownTimer`](../core-components/channel.mdx#cooldowntimer)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={slowMode} alt='Unthemed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

### Pin Message Feature

"Pin Message" action within overlay now allows you to pin a message to channel.

Pinned messages allow users to highlight important messages, make announcements, or temporarily promote content.
Pinning a message is, by default, restricted to certain user roles, but this is flexible.
Each channel can have multiple pinned messages and these can be created or updated with or without an expiration.

To read more about how to retrieve pinned messages or search pinned messages, please read the documentation on
[Pinned Messages](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/pinned_messages/).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={pinMessageAction} alt='Unthemed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
  <img src={pinnedMessage} alt='Themed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

### Better Handlings Of User Capabilities on Channel

Features and UI components have been configured to use the `own_capabilities` returned by backend, improving the consistency
between SDK features and permissions/config/settings applied on application. To read more about these capabilities, please follow the documentation - https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/channel_capabilities/

You can override these capabilities on UI level by providing [`overrideOwnCapabilities`](../core-components/channel.mdx) prop on Channel component:

```tsx
<Channel
  overrideOwnCapabilities={{
    banChannelMembers: false, // hides "Block User" message action.
    deleteAnyMessage: false, // hides "Delete Message" action for received message.
    deleteOwnMessage: false, // hides "Delete Message" action for own message.
    flagMessage: false, // hides "Flag Message" action.
    pinMessage: false, // hides "Pin Message" action.
    quoteMessage: false, // hides "Reply" action.
    readEvents: false, // hides read receipts.
    sendLinks: false, // disallows sending links with message.
    sendMessage: false, // disallows sending a message.
    sendReaction: false, // hides reaction selector in overlay.
    sendReply: false, // hides "Thread Reply" message action.
    sendTypingEvents: false, // disallows sending typing events
    updateAnyMessage: false, // hides "Edit Message" action for received message.
    updateOwnMessage: false, // hides "Edit Message" action for own message.
    uploadFile: false, // hides attach button on message input.
  }}
```

### Replaced next/prev Giphy Navigation With Shuffle

Next and previous buttons on giphy message have been replaced with shuffle button, since Giphy
api doesn't support pagination and it resulted into confusing user experience.

### Dropped BlurView Package

- Background for the overlay which opens up when user long-presses on a message, has been replaced with
  opacity based background instead of [BlurView](https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-blur) [#874](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/874)
  This dependency caused a lot of issues due to its underlying native [BlurView](https://github.com/Dimezis/BlurView) dependency.
  Thus we decided to get rid of this hurdle by dropping this peer dependency.

### Performance Improvements

- `react-native-reanimated` based animations have been removed from Message component for performance reason [#987](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/987).
  - Long press animation on message UI has been removed
  - `animatedLongPress` prop has been removed from `Channel` component.
- Redundant http requests for downloading image attachments have been fixed [#1010](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/1010)
- Performance intensive legacy image viewer behaviour has been turned off by default [#1006](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/1006).
  Please take a look at description of the prop [legacyImageViewerSwipeBehaviour](../core-components/channel.mdx#legacyimageviewerswipebehaviour) for details.

### Improved Customizability

#### Autocomplete suggestions

Following two new props on `Channel` componenent allows customizing UI for autocomplete suggestions list:

- [`AutoCompleteSuggestionHeader`](../core-components/channel.mdx#autocompletesuggestionheader)
- [`AutoCompleteSuggestionList`](../core-components/channel.mdx#autocompletesuggestionlist)
- [`AutoCompleteSuggestionItem`](../core-components/channel.mdx#autocompletesuggestionitem)

For details please read the docs on [Autocomplete Suggestions Customizations](../guides/auto_complete_suggestion_list_customizations.mdx)

#### Message Actions

Following two new props on `OverlayProvider` component allows customizing UI for message actions:

- [`MessageActionList`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx#messageactionlist)
- [`MessageActionListItem`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx#messageactionlistitem)

Additionally styles of the message actions can be customized using following new theme keys:

```tsx
overlay: {
  messageActions: {
    actionContainer: ViewStyle;
    icon: ViewStyle;
    title: TextStyle;
  }
}
```

A seperate guide has been added to documentation for details of [How To Customize Message Actions UI](../guides/message_actions_customization.mdx#how-to-customize-message-action-ui)

#### Deleted Messages

Visibility of deleted messages can be configured using a prop `deletedMessagesVisibilityType` on Channel component.

```tsx
<Channel deletedMessagesVisibilityType={'never'} />
```

This prop has following 4 possible values:

- `always`: The deleted messages in the channel will be visible to both the sender and receiver.
- `never`: The deleted messages will not be visible to anyone.
- `sender`: The deleted messages in the channel will only be visible to sender.
- `receiver`: The deleted messages in the channel will only be visible to receiver.

#### Overlay Reactions User Avatar

Avatar of users (shown in OverlayReactions component) who reacted to message, can now be customized
using a prop on `OverlayProvide` component - [`OverlayReactionsAvatar`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx#overlayreactionsavatar).

### Fixes Issues

#### Warning about Virtualized List wrapped inside ScrollView

Following warning from v3 of SDK has been fixed now.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={scrollViewWarning} alt='Unthemed' width='100%' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

This warning was a result of `ScrollView` wrapped around `FlatList` inside overlay. Purpose of the wrapping ScrollView was to make overlay scrollable in case
message text content is too long. The UX and this warning has been fixed by removing the ScrollView and truncating the text content of message within overlay.
You can customize the truncation length of message text by providing a prop [`messageTextNumberOfLines`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx#messagetextnumberoflines) (number) on `OverlayProvider`.

```tsx
<OverlayProvider messageTextNumberOfLines={300}>{/** child components */}</OverlayProvider>
```

#### ChannelList ignores updated filters if api call is in progress

https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/issues/678

If the screen which creates the filter prop for ChannelList quickly renders two or more
different filters, only the first filter will be fetched, with the subsequent filters
being discarded. This results in a stale ChannelList until it is manually refreshed.

#### Failed messages can't be deleted

Delete action on failed message would result in error previously, which has been fixed in this release.

#### Mentioned users get removed after editing message

https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/issues/1023

#### Url parsing crashes the app when text contains special character

Application would crash if the message text contains special character and someone
replies to the message. This has been fixed in this release.
