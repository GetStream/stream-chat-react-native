import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

This guide highlights the changes introduced from v4 to v5.

## Prop or Context Changes

The following values in [`ImageGalleryContext`](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/reactnative/v5/contexts/image-gallery-context/#value) have been renamed:

- `image` -> `selectedMessage`
- `setImage` -> `setSelectedMessage`
- `images` -> `messages`
- `setImages` -> `setMessages`

## Dependency Changes

- If you have installed `stream-chat` dependency explicitly in your application, then upgrade it to v7:

  ```bash
  yarn add stream-chat@7.0.0
  ```

- Replace [`@react-native-community/cameraroll`](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll) dependency with [`@react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll):

  ```bash
  yarn remove @react-native-community/cameraroll
  yarn add @react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll
  ```

## Unique Chat Component Instance

  Until v4, you could provide a separate `Chat` component for each usage of `Channel` component or `ChannelList` component.
  But from v5, you must provide only one instance of the `Chat` component within your application.
  This component needs to be a parent for all the chat-related components such as `ChannelList`, `Channel` or `Thread`.
