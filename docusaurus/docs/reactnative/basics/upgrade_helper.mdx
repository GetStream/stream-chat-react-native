## Add a required `threadList` prop

Add a `threadList` prop on `Channel` component which wraps the Thread component as following:

(This change is only required if you use `Thread` component within your application. )

```tsx
<Channel
  channel={channel}
  thread={thread}
  threadList
>
    <Thread />
  </View>
</Channel>
```

### `blockUser`

prop as mentioned in [example](../guides/message_actions_customization.mdx#how-to-add-a-custom-message-action)

## Update The Dependencies

Since v4, peer dependency `react-native-blur` has been removed from the SDK. Blur background of overlay has been
replaced with opacity based background instead. So unless this dependency is used explicitely within application, it
can be safely removed.

```sh
yarn remove react-native-blur
npx pod-install
```

## Whats new in v4?

### Slow Mode Feature

Slow mode helps reduce noise on a channel by limiting users to a maximum of 1 message per cooldown interval.
Slow mode is disabled by default and can be enabled/disabled via the Dashboard, using the Chat Explorer.

For more details, please check the documentation for [slow mode](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/slow_mode/?language=javascript#channel-slow-mode)

When cooldown interval kicks in, `SendButton` (to send message) will be replaced with a countdown timer
This countdown timer can be customized using a prop on Channel component - [`CooldownTimer`](../core-components/channel.mdx#cooldowntimer)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={slowMode} alt='Unthemed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

### Pin Message Feature

"Pin Message" action within overlay now allows you to pin a message to channel.

Pinned messages allow users to highlight important messages, make announcements, or temporarily promote content.
Pinning a message is, by default, restricted to certain user roles, but this is flexible.
Each channel can have multiple pinned messages and these can be created or updated with or without an expiration.

To read more about how to retrieve pinned messages or search pinned messages, please read the documentation on
[Pinned Messages](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/pinned_messages/).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={pinMessageAction} alt='Unthemed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
  <img src={pinnedMessage} alt='Themed' width='280' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

### Better Handlings Of User Capabilities on Channel

Features and UI components have been configured to use the `own_capabilities` returned by backend, improving the consistency
between SDK features and permissions/config/settings applied on application. To read more about these capabilities, please follow the documentation - https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/channel_capabilities/

You can override these capabilities on UI level by providing [`overrideOwnCapabilities`](../core-components/channel.mdx) prop on Channel component:

```tsx
<Channel
  overrideOwnCapabilities={{
    banChannelMembers: false, // hides "Block User" message action.
    deleteAnyMessage: false, // hides "Delete Message" action for received message.
    deleteOwnMessage: false, // hides "Delete Message" action for own message.
    flagMessage: false, // hides "Flag Message" action.
    pinMessage: false, // hides "Pin Message" action.
    quoteMessage: false, // hides "Reply" action.
    readEvents: false, // hides read receipts.
    sendLinks: false, // disallows sending links with message.
    sendMessage: false, // disallows sending a message.
    sendReaction: false, // hides reaction selector in overlay.
    sendReply: false, // hides "Thread Reply" message action.
    sendTypingEvents: false, // disallows sending typing events
    updateAnyMessage: false, // hides "Edit Message" action for received message.
    updateOwnMessage: false, // hides "Edit Message" action for own message.
    uploadFile: false, // hides attach button on message input.
  }}
```

### UI/UX Changes and Performance Improvements

- Background for the overlay which opens up when user long-presses on a message, has been replaced with
  opacity based background instead of [BlurView](https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-blur) [#874](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/874)
  This dependency caused a lot of issues due to its underlying native [BlurView](https://github.com/Dimezis/BlurView) dependency.
  Thus we decided to get rid of this hurdle by dropping this peer dependency.

- `react-native-reanimated` based animations have been removed from Message component for performance reason [#987](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/987).
  - Long press animation on message UI has been removed
  - `animatedLongPress` prop has been removed from `Channel` component.
- Redundant http requests for downloading image attachments have been fixed [#1010](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/1010)
- Performance intensive legacy image viewer behaviour has been turned off by default [#1006](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/1006).
  Please take a look at description of the prop [legacyImageViewerSwipeBehaviour](../core-components/channel.mdx#legacyimageviewerswipebehaviour) for details.

### Improved Customizability

#### Autocomplete suggestions

Following two new props on `Channel` componenent allows customizing UI for autocomplete suggestions list:

- `AutoCompleteSuggestionHeader`
- `AutoCompleteSuggestionList`
- `AutoCompleteSuggestionItem`

For details please read the docs on [Autocomplete Suggestions Customizations](../guides/auto_complete_suggestion_list_customizations.mdx)

#### Message Actions

Following two new props on `OverlayProvider` component allows customizing UI for message actions:

- `MessageActionList`
- `MessageActionListItem`

Additionally styles of the message actions can be customized using following new theme keys:

```tsx
overlay: {
  messageActions: {
    actionContainer: ViewStyle;
    icon: ViewStyle;
    title: TextStyle;
  }
}
```

A seperate guide has been added to documentation for details of [How To Customize Message Actions UI](../guides/message_actions_customization.mdx#how-to-customize-message-action-ui)

#### Deleted Messages

Visibility of deleted messages can be configured using a prop `deletedMessagesVisibilityType` on Channel component.

```tsx
<Channel deletedMessagesVisibilityType={'never'} />
```

This prop has following 4 possible values:

- `always`: The deleted messages in the channel will be visible to both the sender and receiver.
- `never`: The deleted messages will not be visible to anyone.
- `sender`: The deleted messages in the channel will only be visible to sender.
- `receiver`: The deleted messages in the channel will only be visible to receiver.

### Fixes Issues

#### Warning about Virtualized List wrapped inside ScrollView

Following warning from v3 of SDK has been fixed now.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src={scrollViewWarning} alt='Unthemed' width='100%' style={{ objectFit: 'contain', paddingBottom: '8px' }} />
</div>

This warning was a result of `ScrollView` wrapped around `FlatList` inside overlay. Purpose of the wrapping ScrollView was to make overlay scrollable in case
message text content is too long. The UX and this warning has been fixed by removing the ScrollView and truncating the text content of message within overlay.
You can customize the truncation length of message text by providing a prop [`messageTextNumberOfLines`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx#messagetextnumberoflines) (number) on `OverlayProvider`.

```tsx
<OverlayProvider messageTextNumberOfLines={300}>{/** child components */}</OverlayProvider>
```
