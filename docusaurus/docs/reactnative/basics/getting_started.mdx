The Basics section of this documentation introduces the fundamentals of Stream Chat for React Native.
It will cover installing Stream Chat within your project, give you some troubleshooting tips, and provide an overview of what is possible using the library.
This should be considered a primer before delving into the UI and Core Components or Customization sections. We support creating apps both using [RN CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

## Installation

Your [environment should be setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and a project created prior to beginning the installation.

### Add Required dependencies

Install the required packages in your React Native project.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash
  yarn add stream-chat-react-native
  # or
  npm install stream-chat-react-native
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash
npx expo install stream-chat-expo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Stream Chat has a number of peer dependencies that are required to take advantage of all of the out of the box features.
It is suggested you follow the install instructions for each package to ensure it is properly setup.
Most if not all of the required packages now support auto-linking so setup should be minimal. Those with known [additional steps](#additional-steps) have been noted.

#### Version compatibilities

To be able to use the Stream Chat React Native SDK, a few dependencies must meet the following version requirements:

| react-native | stream-chat-react-native/stream-chat-expo (min required) | react-native-reanimated (min required) | react-native-quick-sqlite (min required) |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

#### Platform compatibilities

We only support **Android** and **iOS** as platforms for the React Native SDK. We do not support **Web** currently, but this is in our backlog, and we plan to take this up in the future.
As an alternative, you can use Stream's [React SDK](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/) for Web. The React SDK follows the same API and Component convention and is very similar to the React Native SDK.

### Additional Steps

For some of the packages listed below, there are additional steps required to setup the package:

- `react-native-reanimated` - [additional installation steps](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation)

  Add the Reanimated babel plugin to your babel.config.js:

  ```js
    module.exports = {
        ...
        plugins: [
            ...
            'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
        ],
    };
  ```

- `react-native-gesture-handler` - [additional installation steps](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/#android)

  RNGH requires the package to be imported at the **top of the entry file** before anything else, this is usually your `App.js` or `index.js` file.

  ```tsx
  import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
  import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';

  import App from './App';
  import { name as appName } from './app.json';

  AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
  ```

  Also wrap your entry point with `<GestureHandlerRootView>` or `gestureHandlerRootHO`

  ```jsx
  import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
  import { OverlayProvider } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <GestureHandlerRootView>
        <OverlayProvider>{/* Your app code goes here */}</OverlayProvider>
      </GestureHandlerRootView>
    );
  }
  ```

  Please take a look at our Example Application for reference.

:::note

If you are planning to use file picker functionality, make sure you enable iCloud capability in your app - [Enable iCloud capability](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ac300ca7e3bbab573a76c151469a89efd8b31e72/68747470733a2f2f33313365353938373731386233343661616638332d66356538323532373066323961383466373838313432333431303338343334322e73736c2e6366312e7261636b63646e2e636f6d2f313431313932303637342d656e61626c652d69636c6f75642d64726976652e706e67)

### Add Optional Dependencies

#### Video playing support

Install [`react-native-video`](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video) for RN CLI or [`expo-av`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/av/) for Expo CLI in your React Native project.

> Available in stream-chat-react-native >= v4.7.0

Installing this package allows you to play the video and audio files/attachments in the chat. Otherwise by default, video and audio files will be opened and downloaded through the default browser of the device.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash
yarn add react-native-video
# or
npm install react-native-video
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash
npx expo install expo-av
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We require [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) to be the media player on Android. To make `react-native-video` use ExoPlayer, add the following in `android/settings.gradle`:

```
include ':react-native-video'
project(':react-native-video').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-video/android-exoplayer')
```

#### Sharing attachments

Install [`react-native-share`](https://github.com/react-native-share/react-native-share) for RN CLI or [`expo-sharing`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sharing/) in your React Native project.

Installing this package will allow your users to share attachments from the gallery using the native sharing interface on their devices.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },

npx expo install expo-sharing
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Haptic feedback

Install [`react-native-haptic-feedback`](https://github.com/junina-de/react-native-haptic-feedback) for RN CLI or [`expo-haptics`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics/) for Expo CLI in your React Native project.

Installing this package will enable haptic feedback when scaling images in the image gallery if the scaling hits the higher or lower limits for its value.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Copying messages

Install [`@react-native-clipboard/clipboard`](https://github.com/react-native-clipboard/clipboard) for RN CLI or [`expo-clipboard`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/clipboard/) for Expo ClI to be able to copy messages to the clipboard.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash

# or
npm install @react-native-clipboard/clipboard
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash
npx expo install expo-clipboard
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### File Uploads through file picker

Install [`react-native-document-picker`](https://github.com/rnmods/react-native-document-picker) for RN CLI or [`expo-document-picker`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/document-picker/) for Expo CLI to access the file picker and upload the file.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash
yarn add react-native-document-picker
# or
npm install react-native-document-picker
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash
npx expo install expo-document-picker
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### AndroidX Support

> AndroidX is a major step forward in the Android ecosystem, and the old support library artifacts are being deprecated.
> For 0.60, React Native has been migrated over to AndroidX.
> This is a breaking change, and your native code and dependencies will need to be migrated as well.

(Reference: <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#androidx-support>)

Dependencies such as `react-native-document-picker`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, and `react-native-reanimated` don't have AndroidX support.
But an awesome tool named [jetifier](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier) is quite useful to patch these dependencies with AndroidX support.
