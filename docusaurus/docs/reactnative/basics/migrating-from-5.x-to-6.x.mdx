## Changes

The following are the crucial changes of the Stream Chat React Native SDK from version 5.x to 6.x:

### Change `react-native-fs` to `react-native-blob-util`

The `react-native-fs` package has been replaced to `react-native-blob-util` in favour of the former not being actively maintained. You can replace it by running the following commands:

```bash
yarn remove react-native-fs
yarn add react-native-blob-util
```

### Change `react-native-image-resizer` to `@bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer`

The `react-native-image-resizer` package has been replaced with `@bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer`.

Since version 3.0.0, this library has been moved from `react-native-image-resizer` to `@bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer`.

You can replace it by running the following commands:

```bash
yarn remove react-native-image-resizer
yarn add @bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer
```

### Change `react-native-quick-sqlite` to `op-sqlite`

The `react-native-quick-sqlite` package has been replaced with `op-sqlite`. This is a faster alternative, and can help us with our new architecture endeavors.

You can replace it by running the following commands:

```bash
yarn remove react-native-quick-sqlite
yarn add op-sqlite
```

### Remove the usage of `@stream-io/flat-list-mvcp`

The dependency on `@stream-io/flat-list-mvcp` package has been removed in favour of React Native's [`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) component supporting [`maintainVisibleContentPosition`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#maintainvisiblecontentposition) from React Native version `>=0.72`. You can replace it by using the `FlatList` component directly.

```bash
yarn remove @stream-io/flat-list-mvcp
```

```tsx
// removed-line
import { FlatList } from '@stream-io/flat-list-mvcp';
import { registerNativeHandlers } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

registerNativeHandlers({
  // removed-line
  FlatList: FlatList,
});
```

This also involves not passing the `FlatList` component as a handler to [`registerNativeHandlers`](../customization/native-handlers.mdx#overriding-handlers) anymore.

### Remove `NetInfo` from the native handlers

The `NetInfo` package has been removed from the native handlers. This also involves not passing the `NetInfo` utility as a handler to [`registerNativeHandlers`](../customization/native-handlers.mdx#overriding-handlers) anymore.

```tsx
import { registerNativeHandlers } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

registerNativeHandlers({
  // removed-line
  NetInfo: NetInfo,
});
```

### Change the type of `quotedMessage` in `MessageInputContext`

The type of `quotedMessage` is changed from `MessageType |  boolean` to `MessageType | undefined` for better in the `MessageInputContext`.
