Installation and usage of our Stream Chat React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native. You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

For Expo, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

### Add Stream's Chat SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Chat React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  groupId='rn-platform'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add stream-chat-react-native
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx expo install stream-chat-expo
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Stream Chat React Native SDK requires installing some peer dependencies to provide you with a great chat experience. You can run the following command to install them:

<Tabs
  defaultValue='rncli'
  groupId='rn-platform'
  values={[
    { label: 'RN CLI', value: 'rncli' },
    { label: 'Expo', value: 'expo' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='rncli'>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add @react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll @react-native-community/netinfo @stream-io/flat-list-mvcp react-native-fs react-native-gesture-handler react-native-image-crop-picker react-native-image-resizer react-native-reanimated react-native-svg
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='expo'>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx expo install @stream-io/flat-list-mvcp @react-native-community/netinfo expo-file-system expo-image-manipulator expo-image-picker expo-media-library react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-svg
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Please follow along the linked documentation of each optional dependencies so as to support them correctly in your application.

### Additional Steps

Some dependencies require us to make changes to our application for all functionalities to be available.

The most important steps to get started are:

- Add the Babel plugin for [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#installation#babel-plugin) to your `babel.config.js` file in your application folder:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ... // don't add it here :)
  ],
  plugins: [
    ...
    // highlight-next-line
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
  ],
};
```

:::caution
`react-native-reanimated/plugin` has to be listed last.
:::

- After installation, wrap your entry point with `<GestureHandlerRootView>` or `gestureHandlerRootHOC`:

```js
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

export default function App() {
  return <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>{/* content */}</GestureHandlerRootView>;
}
```

:::note
The entry point of your app exists usually either in `index.js` or `App.tsx` file. In case of navigation with Expo Router v3.x, the entry point is inside `app/_layout.js`.
:::

Please also follow the steps mentioned in the links below for corresponding dependencies:

- `react-native` - [additional installation steps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#gif-and-webp-support-on-android)
- `react-native-image-crop-picker` - [additional installation steps](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker#step-3)
- `react-native-cameraroll` - [additional installation steps](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll#permissions)

Now you should be able to run the app on simulator by running following command:
