We would be building a custom video component in the application using some of the available open-source packages and using the `FileAttachment` customization prop which the `Channel` component allows us to use.

Uploading a video attachment is possible using the file upload in the attachment picker.

To add the video attachment and view the file we follow these steps:

## Installing the packages

We use two packages for rendering the video and creating the thumbnail of the video.
For rendering the video in the message list we recommend using the [react-native-video](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-video) package.
To create the thumbnail of the video attachment we recommend using the [react-native-create-thumbnail](https://github.com/souvik-ghosh/react-native-create-thumbnail) package.

Note: [react-native-video](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-video) and [react-native-create-thumbnail](https://github.com/souvik-ghosh/react-native-create-thumbnail) are external package.

After installing it do not forget to link the package to your project. Follow the guide in the documentation for Android and iOS installation for `react-native-video` - [here](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video#installation) and for `react-native-create-thumbnail` - [here](https://github.com/souvik-ghosh/react-native-create-thumbnail#getting-started).

After the package is installed, we can use the `Video` component it provides to render video.

## Creating a Video Card Thumbnail component

To create a video thumbnail we have already installed the package `react-native-create-thumbnail`. This package takes in the attachment `asset_url` and returns the thumbnail image URL after saving it to the local file directory. You can also cache the file so that it doesn't gets saved every time the screen is loaded.

In our tutorial, we render the thumbnail in the `ImageBackground` component. We have added a `Play` button on the thumbnail and on clicking the button a screen opens up with the video rendered therein.

The example is as follows:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { ImageBackground, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import { Attachment } from 'stream-chat';
import { FileAttachment, useMessageContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';
import { createThumbnail } from 'react-native-create-thumbnail';
import { Play } from '../icons/Play';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  backgroundVideo: {
    height: 200,
    width: 250,
  },
  image: {
    borderBottomLeftRadius: 14,
    borderTopLeftRadius: 14,
    borderTopRightRadius: 14,
  },
  playButton: {
    marginBottom: 'auto',
    marginLeft: 'auto',
    marginRight: 'auto',
    marginTop: 'auto',
    position: 'relative',
  },
});

export const VideoCard = ({ attachment, onPress }) => {
  const [thumbnail, setThumbnail] = useState(null);
  const { onLongPress } = useMessageContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    createThumbnail({
      cacheName: attachment.title,
      format: 'png',
      url: attachment.asset_url,
    })
      .then(response => {
        setThumbnail(response.path);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  }, [attachment]);

  const isVideo = attachment.type === 'video';

  if (isVideo) {
    return (
      <TouchableOpacity
        onLongPress={event => {
          if (onLongPress) {
            onLongPress({
              emitter: 'gallery',
              event,
            });
          }
        }}
        onPress={onPress}
      >
        <ImageBackground imageStyle={styles.image} source={{ uri: thumbnail }} style={styles.backgroundVideo}>
          <Play fill={'#fff'} height={50} style={styles.playButton} width={50} />
        </ImageBackground>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
  } else {
    return <FileAttachment attachment={attachment} />;
  }
};
```

The `onPress` prop is a handler that triggers the navigation to the VideoDisplay screen.
To cache the thumbnail in the local file system we should provide the name of the file using which it will be saved in the directory.

## Rendering the video component

We use the `react-native-video` package to render the video component. An example for the same is as follows:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { RouteProp } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { StackNavigationProp } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import Video from 'react-native-video';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  backgroundVideo: {
    height: '100%',
    width: '100%',
  },
});

export const VideoDisplayScreen = ({
  route: {
    params: { attachment },
  },
}) => (
  <Video
    controls={true}
    key={attachment.asset_url}
    paused={false}
    resizeMode='none'
    source={{ uri: attachment.asset_url }}
    style={styles.backgroundVideo}
  />
);
```

Note: There are several features that can be customized in the Video component for which you can refer to the documentation [here](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video#configurable-props).
