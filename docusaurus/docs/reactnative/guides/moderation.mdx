Stream Chat has support for several moderation actions, such as flagging, muting, banning and shadow banning. You can find more details about the available low-level client moderation tools on this [page](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/ios-swift/moderation/?language=swift).

You can moderate flagged messages and users through Stream's [moderation dashboard](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/moderation/?language=javascript).

### Moderation Categories

For each channel type, you can enable AI moderation, consisting of 4 moderation categories:

- Semantic Filters
- Commercial Spam
- Platform Circumvention
- Blocklists

For each moderation category, you can configure an action that will be performed after a message falls into that category.

The available actions are:

- Flag
- Block
- Bounce
- Bounce then flag
- Bounce then block

### React Native SDK Handling

In the React Native SDK, you can check if a message was moderated, by checking the `moderation_details` value in the chat message, which is not defined or `undefined` for regular messages.

If a message is blocked by moderation, the message `type` is `error` and the message text contains `Message was blocked by moderation policies`.

If a message is bounced by moderation, the message `type` is `error` and the message `moderation_details` value is defined.

### UI Components handling

The React Native SDK handles the bounced messages by default. When a message is bounced, there is a visual indicator on the message view to reflect that.

When you press/long press on a message, you can perform several default actions on it, such as editing and deleting it, as well as trying to resent it.

:::note
When you try to resend a message when bounced, if the bounced then flag settings is applied, the message will be marked as flag after being sent the second time.

When you try to resend a message when bounced, if the bounced then blocked settings is applied, the message will be blocked after being sent the second time.

You can customize the default actions on the bounced message action handler component, that is, [MessageBounce](../ui-components/message-bounce.mdx) component by passing it to the [`Channel`](../core-components/channel.mdx#messagebounce) component.
