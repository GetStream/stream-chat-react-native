title: React Native New Architecture
---

Starting v6 we support the [new architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page) for the React Native Chat SDK.

To be compatible with the new architecture, it is recommended that you use React Native version `0.75.4` and above for React Native CLI and `>=51` for Expo.

### Dependencies

On Native CLI, we recommend you to be on the following versions or higher of the peer dependencies to be able to run the new architecture:

| Dependencies                        | Versions   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `@op-engineering/op-sqlite`         | `>=9.3.0`  |
| `@react-native-clipboard/clipboard` | `>=1.4.1`  |
| `react-native-blob-util`            | `>=0.17.0` |
| `react-native-document-picker`      | `>=9.1.1`  |
| `react-native-gesture-handler`      | `>=2.15.0` |
| `react-native-haptic-feedback`      | `>=2.2.0`  |
| `react-native-image-picker`         | `>=7.1.1`  |
| `react-native-reanimated`           | `>=3.9.0`  |
| `react-native-share`                | `>=10.0.2` |
| `react-native-svg`                  | `>=15.2.0` |

Few of the dependencies we rely on are not fully new architecture compatible yet.

1. `react-native-audio-recorder-player` and `react-native-video` work on interop mode.
2. `react-native-document-picker` doesn't support the bridgeless mode. Please use [`@react-native-documents/picker`](https://react-native-documents.github.io/docs/sponsor-only/intro) if you want the bridgeless mode. You can register your own native handler with us using our [Native Handler](../customization/native-handlers.mdx) guide.
3. `@react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll` doesn't work alongside the Image resizer module that we have. We recommend using the native image picker for now. You can read [the guide](./native-image-picker.mdx) here.

   :::note
   Although the above dependencies are not fully compatible with the new architecture, you can still use them in your project. They doesn't stop you from building the app on both iOS and Android.
   :::

For expo, make sure you are on the latest version of the dependencies with the current expo version you have.

### Known issues and limitations

- The audio recorder is not fully compatible with the new architecture, so you might face some issues while recording the audio and playing it using `react-native-audio-recorder-player`. We are working on it to fix the issues.
- The image gallery animations behaves differently and seem to lag a bit on the new architecture specially when you use the pan gesture to drag down the image. We are working on it to fix the issues.

Please feel free to report any issues you face while using the new architecture.
