Easiest way to integrate push notifications in your Chat applications is using Firebase. [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) and [Notifee](https://notifee.app/)
are the officially recommended collection of packages that brings React Native support for all Firebase services on both Android and iOS apps.

## Requirements

<!-- TODO: Change to new docs for links -->

- Push notifications are sent only for new messages.
- Only channel members receive push messages.
- Members receive push notifications regardless of their online status.
- Replies inside a [thread](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/threads/?language=javascript) are only sent to users that are part of that thread:
  - They posted at least one message
  - They were mentioned
- Messages from muted users are not sent.
- Messages are sent to all registered devices for a user (up to 25) .
- Up to 100 members of a channel will receive push notifications.
- skip_push is marked as false, as described [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/send_message/?language=javascript#complex-example).
- push_notifications is enabled (default) on the channel type for message is sent.

:::note

- If you would like get push notifications only when users are offline, please contact to support.
- Push notifications require membership. Watching a channel isn't enough.

## Firebase Setup

Follow the steps mentioned on Firebase documentation setup Firebase.

1. [Create a firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client#create-firebase-project).
2. Register your [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#register_your_app_with_firebase) and [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client#register-app) app with Firebase app.
3. Download a Firebase configuration file for [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client) and [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#add_a_firebase_configuration_file).
4. Install React Native Firebase.

   ```sh
   # Install & setup the app module
   yarn add @react-native-firebase/app

   # Install the messaging module
   yarn add @react-native-firebase/messaging
   ```

5. [Setup Android credentials](https://rnfirebase.io/#2-android-setup).
6. [Setup iOS credentials](https://rnfirebase.io/#3-ios-setup).

## Get The Firebase Credentials

These credentials are the [private key file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#:~:text=To%20generate%20a%20private%20key%20file%20for%20your%20service%20account%3A) for your service account, in firebase console. To generate a private key file for your service account:

- In the Firebase console, open Settings > Service Accounts.
- Click Generate New Private Key, then confirm by clicking Generate Key.
- Securely store the JSON file containing the key.

This JSON file contains the credentials which needs to be uploaded to Stream server as explained in next step.

## Upload Firebase Credentials

You can upload your firebase credentials either using dashboard or using the app settings api:

### Using Dashboard

1. Go to Chat Overview page on Stream Dashboard

<img src={chatOverviewPage} />

2. Enable Firebase Notification toggle on Chat Overview

<img src={firebaseNotificationsToggle} />

3. Enter your Firebase Credentials in input box below the toggle and **press "Save" button**.

### Using API

You can also enable firebase notifications and upload the firebase credentials using api:

```js
const client = StreamChat.getInstance('api_key', 'api_secret');
client.updateAppSettings({
  push_config: {
    version: 'v2'
  },
  firebase_config: {
    credentials_json: fs.readFileSync(
      './firebase-credentials.json',
      'utf-8',
    ),
 });
```

## Registering a device with Stream

Once you configure Firebase server key and set it up on Stream dashboard, a device that is supposed to receive push notifications needs to be registered at Stream backend. This is usually done by listening for Firebase device token.

:::caution

Please note that, `client.addDevice` call requires user token to be set on client.
So `client.addDevice` call should be made after `client.connectUser` in code.

:::

```js
// Request Push Notification permission from device.
const requestPermission = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission();
  const enabled =
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED || authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL;

  if (enabled) {
    console.log('Authorization status:', authStatus);
  }
};

const App = () => {
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    let unsubscribeTokenRefreshListener;
    // Register FCM token with stream chat server.
    const registerPushToken = async () => {
      const token = await messaging().getToken();
      await client.addDevice(token, 'firebase');

      unsubscribeTokenRefreshListener = messaging().onTokenRefresh(async newToken => {
        await client.addDevice(newToken, 'firebase');
      });
    };

    const init = async () => {
      await client.connectUser({ id: USER_ID }, USER_TOKEN);

      await requestPermission();
      await registerPushToken();

      setIsReady(true);
    };

    init();

    return async () => {
      await client?.disconnectUser();
      unsubscribeTokenRefreshListener?.();
    };
  }, []);

  if (!isReady) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Chat client={client}>{/* Child components of Chat go here */}</Chat>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

## Display Notification To User

Push notifications are delivered as data payloads that the applications can use to convert into the same data types that are received when working with the APIs.

When a message received by the Chat API, according to the delivery rules, it kicks a job that sends a regular data message (as below) to configured push providers on your app.
According to the battery and the online status of the device, push providers deliver this payload to the actual devices.

This is the main payload that will be sent to device:

```json
{
  "sender": "stream.chat",
  "type": "message.new",
  "version": "v2",
  "message_id": "d152f6c1-8c8c-476d-bfd6-59c15c20548a",
  "id": "d152f6c1-8c8c-476d-bfd6-59c15c20548a",
  "channel_type": "messaging",
  "channel_id": "company-chat",
  "cid": "messaging:company-chat"
}
```

When a device receives this payload, you can request the relevent message details by calling `chatClient.getMessage()` api and generate a local notification on device.
For this purpose you can use [Notifee](https://notifee.app/), which is a A feature rich notifications library for React Native.

### When App Is In Foreground

To listen to messages in the foreground, call the [`onMessage`](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage#foreground-state-messages) method inside of your application code and display a notification to end user.
Code executed via this handler has access to React context and is able to interact with your application (e.g. updating the state or UI).

:::note

Generally chat applications don't show push notifications when the app is the foreground, so you may want to ignore this step depending on your product requirement.

:::

```jsx
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';
import notifee from '@notifee/react-native';

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
    const message = await chatClient.getMessage(remoteMessage.data.id);

    await notifee.displayNotification({
      title: message.message.text,
      body: message.message.text,
      android: {
        channelId: 'chat-messages',
        pressAction: {
          id: 'default',
        },
      },
    });
  });

  return unsubscribe;
}, []);
```

### When App Is In Background or In Quit State

When the application is in a background or quit state, the onMessage handler will not be called when receiving messages.
Instead, you need to setup a background callback handler via the [`setBackgroundMessageHandler`](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage#background--quit-state-messages) method.

To setup a background handler, call the `setBackgroundMessageHandler` outside of your application logic as early as possible:

For more details about headless state of application, please read the documentation of [RN Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage#background-application-state)

```jsx
// index.js
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';
import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';

// Register background handler
messaging().setBackgroundMessageHandler(async remoteMessage => {
  const client = StreamChat.getInstance('api_key');

  // You can also provide tokenProvider instead of static token - await client._setToken({ id: userId }, tokenProvider)
  client._setToken(
    {
      id: 'user_id',
    },
    'user_token',
  );

  const message = await client.getMessage(remoteMessage.data.id);

  notifee.displayNotification({
    title: message.message.text,
    body: JSON.stringify(remoteMessage),
    android: {
      channelId: 'msg',
      pressAction: {
        id: 'default',
      },
    },
  });
});

function HeadlessCheck({ isHeadless }) {
  if (isHeadless) {
    // App has been launched in the background by iOS, ignore the UI rendering.
    return null;
  }

  return <App />;
}

function App() {
  // Your application
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('app', () => HeadlessCheck);
```

## Interact with Push Notification

When a user interacts with your notification by pressing on it, the default behavior on iOS is to open the application.
For Android, you need to explicitly define a `pressAction` with at least an `id`, when you call `notifee.displayNotification()` to [open the application](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/android/interaction#opening-the-application).

But for practical application, you generally may want to navigate to specific channel upon press.
For this purpose [Notifee](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/events) provides set of [event handlers](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/events) which can be used to build UX as required.

### When App Is In Foreground

An application is deemed in the "foreground" under the following situations:

- The device is unlocked.
- The application is running & is in view (foreground).

:::note

**iOS**: onForegroundEvent will be executed in following scenarios

- App is already open, and a user presses the notification.
- App is in the background and if a user presses the notification to bring the app to foreground.

**Android**: onForegroundEvent will be executed in the following scenarios:

- App is already open, and a user presses the notification.

:::

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import notifee, { EventType } from '@notifee/react-native';

function App() {
  // Subscribe to events
  useEffect(() => {
    return notifee.onForegroundEvent(({ type, detail }) => {
      switch (type) {
        case EventType.DISMISSED:
          console.log('User dismissed notification', detail.notification);
          break;
        case EventType.PRESS:
          navigateToChannelScreen(detail.notification.data.channel_id);
          break;
      }
    });
  }, []);
}
```

### When App Is In Background or Quit State

An application is deemed in the "background" under the following situations:

- The device is locked.
- The application is running & is in not in view (minimized).
- The application is killed/quit.

Background tasks run without React context, meaning you cannot update your application UI. You can however perform logic to update a remote database, update local device storage or even display/update a notification with Notifee! An example of a background event would be handling a "Mark as read" action by updating your database and cancelling the notification.

Only a single background event handler can be registered. To register your handler, the onBackgroundEvent method should be registered as early on in your project as possible (e.g. the index.js file):

:::note

**iOS**: onBackgroundEvent will be executed in following scenarios

- App is currently in quit state and user pressed the notification to open the app.

**Android**: onBackgroundEvent will be executed in following scenarios

- App is in background and user presses the notification to bring the app to foreground.
- App is currently in quit state and user pressed the notification to open the app.

:::

```jsx
// index.js
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import notifee, { EventType } from '@notifee/react-native';
import App from './App';

notifee.onBackgroundEvent(async ({ type, detail }) => {
  const { notification, pressAction } = detail;

  // Check if the user opened the app by pressing the notification
  if (type === EventType.PRESS) {
    // Since this function is outside the react context, you will need to somehow
    // communicate with your App context via some kind of event emitter-listener interface.
    navigateToChannelScreen(detail.notification.data.channel_id);
    // Remove the notification
    await notifee.cancelNotification(notification.id);
  }
});

// Register main application
AppRegistry.registerComponent('app', () => App);
```
