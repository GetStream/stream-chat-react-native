title: Debug Stream Chat Application using Flipper plugin
---

## Overview

Flipper is a platform for debugging iOS, Android and React Native apps. You can debug Stream Chat within your application by using our interface within the Flipper Desktop app. This will help you analyze multiple parameters of the application which are a part of Stream Chat React Native interface.

## Features:

- Viewing the authenticated client in the Chat.
- Viewing the Channels, Message and Thread list data as we navigate through the screen.
- Copying and visualizing all the data.

These features are part of the 1st version of this plugin. More features will be added in the future, may you have any ideas/suggestions, please reach out via the [SDK's discussions page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/discussions)

## How to do so?

- Firstly, you would need to install the Flipper plugin within your Desktop client. To do so, follow these steps:

  - Download the Flipper Desktop app from [here](https://fbflipper.com/).
  - After downloading the desktop app, move to **Plugin Manager** section of the app and then select the **Install Plugins** tab.
  - Search for **stream-chat-react-native** and you will find this plugin.
  - Click on Install to install it.

- Next, we will need to install `stream-chat-react-native-devtools` to your application as a dev dependency. This dependency will make communication possible between the RN Stream Chat SDK and the flipper plugin.

  ```
  yarn add --dev stream-chat-react-native-devtools
  ```

  or

  ```
  npm install --save-dev stream-chat-react-native-devtools
  ```

- To interact with the Flipper Plugin you need an additional dependency `react-native-flipper`. You can install it as a dev dependency, as:

  ```
  yarn add --dev react-native-flipper
  ```

  or

  ```
  npm install --save-dev react-native-flipper
  ```

- Wrap `DebugContextProvider` to the root of the component tree to the App component and pass the `useFlipper` function.

  ```tsx
  import { DebugContextProvider } from 'stream-chat-react-native';
  import { useFlipper } from 'stream-chat-react-native-devtools';
  ...

  <DebugContextProvider useFlipper={useFlipper}>
    {/* All other elements of the App component comes here */}
  </DebugContextProvider>
  ```

Kudos ðŸŽ‰, everything else is handled by our SDK, the package [stream-chat-react-native-devtools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-chat-react-native-devtools), and the [Flipper Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flipper-plugin-stream-chat-react-native).
