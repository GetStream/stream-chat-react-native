A method that will be used as a callback whenever send button is clicked on the `CreatePoll` modal. If a custom UI is used for `CreatePollContent`, it can be used as an out-of-the-box method to create and send a poll to the `MessageList`.

It expects to receive an argument that conforms to the `CreatePollData` type that can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts).
