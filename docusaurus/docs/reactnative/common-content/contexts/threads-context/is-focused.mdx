A boolean indicating if the `ThreadList` is currently in focus or not. Essentially a flag that lets us know whether the component is present in the viewport. Whenever present, it controls when updates to the `ThreadList` are active and when they are not. Best used in conjunction with hooks from popular navigation libraries (such as [`useIsFocused()` from React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-is-focused/)) for lazy loading purposes.

Example:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useIsFocused } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { ThreadList } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

export const ThreadListScreen = () => {
  const isFocused = useIsFocused();
  return <ThreadList isFocused={isFocused} />;
};
```
