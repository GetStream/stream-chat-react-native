List of reactions which can be added on message. Provide `id` and `icon` for every reaction that you want to support.
`id` is an identifier for reaction, which is used by backend. And we use `icon` to render UI for that reaction.

Please read [Custom Reaction section](/react-native/guides/message-customization#message-with-custom-reactions) in Guides section.
