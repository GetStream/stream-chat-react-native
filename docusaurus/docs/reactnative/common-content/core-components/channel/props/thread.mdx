A message object that when set indicates a thread is open.
When used with the [`Thread`](/reactnative/ui-components/thread) component this will display the thread.
When used with the standard [`MessageList`](/reactnative/ui-components/message-list) component this will prevent any singleton components in the [`OverlayProvider`](/reactnative/core-components/overlay-provider) form getting out of sync.

:::note

`thread` should be set on all `Channel` components when a thread is open.
