Function called when a user presses an item in the `ChannelList`.
The function is called with the [`Channel` instance](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/creating_channels/?language=javascript) corresponding to the list item as the only parameter.
This callback is often used for navigating to a channel screen.

#### Example

```tsx
onSelect={(channel) => { /** navigation logic */ }}
```

:::note

A `Channel` instance is not serializable and will therefore raise warnings if passed as a param through navigation to another screen.
