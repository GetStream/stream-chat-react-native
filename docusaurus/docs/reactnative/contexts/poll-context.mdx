import Poll from '../common-content/contexts/poll-context/poll.mdx';

The `PollContext` is provided by the [`Poll`](../../ui-components/poll) component. If you are not familiar with React Context API, please read about it on [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

The `PollContext` needs to be used within the [`Channel` component](../../core-components/channel) as it depends on various values provided by it in order to work.

## Basic Usage

The `PollContext` can be consumed by any of the child components of `Channel` as following:

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { CreatePollContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const value = useContext(PollContext);
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `usePollContext` hook provided by library to consume `PollContext`.

```tsx
import { usePollContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const value = usePollContext();
```

## Value

### <div class="label description">_forwarded from [MessageContext](../../contexts/message-context#message)_ props</div> message {#message}

<MessageProp />

### `poll` \*

<Poll />
