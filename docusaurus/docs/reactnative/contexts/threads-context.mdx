The `ThreadsContext` is provided by the [`ThreadList`](../../ui-components/thread-list) component. If you are not familiar with React Context API, please read about it on [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

The `ThreadsContext` needs to be used within the [`Chat` component](../../core-components/chat) as it depends on the [`ChatContext`](./chat-context).

## Basic Usage

The `ThreadsContext` can be consumed by any of the child components of `Chat` as following:

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThreadsContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const value = useContext(ThreadsContext);
```

Alternatively, you can also use `useThreadsContext` hook provided by library to consume `ThreadContext`.

```tsx
import { useThreadsContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const value = useThreadsContext();
```
