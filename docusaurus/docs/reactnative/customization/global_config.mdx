The core of Stream Chat for React Native is it's ability to be customized to your needs.
The new `Global Config` feature allows you to enable and disable features of the library and alter the default behavior of the SDK.

We will be gradually adding more features/options to the global config.
In the future this will be the main way to alter the default behavior of the SDK and it's components.

## When to use a Global Configt

When you want to alter the default behavior of the SDK or it's components.
Please check the available options below to see if there is a config option that fits your needs.

## How to use and alter the global config

Altering the global config can be done by calling the `setConfig` function on the `StreamChatRN` object.
Make sure to call this function before any other components are rendered at the root of your application (App.tsx in most cases).

```tsx
import { StreamChatRN } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

StreamChatRN.setConfig({
  resizableCDNHosts: ['https://my-company-cdn.com'],
  // future config options
});
```

## Available config features/Options

### `resizableCDNHosts`

This option allows you to specify a list of CDNs that offer image resizing.

| Type       | Default                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `string[]` | `['.stream-io-cdn.com']` |
