Stream Chat for React Native uses a number of features that require packages that run native code.
Stream Chat for React Native also supports [Expo](https://expo.io/), which has it's own set of native packages.
To reconcile these differences Stream Chat for React Native is made up of two packages, `stream-chat-react-native-core`, and either `stream-chat-react-native` or `stream-chat-expo`.
The non *core* packages call a function from the core package, `registerNativeHandlers`, this gives the core package access to different native functions that perform the same task, but are different between Expo and vanilla React Native.

## Overriding Handlers

If desired the native handlers can be overridden.
The same function that is called internally to set the handlers can be used to override them, `registerNativeHandlers`.
If the function returns the same type of data as the original function it should seamlessly work with the rest of the SDK.
You should look at the default implementation to ensure any override conforms to the appropriate type definition provided by the SDK.

Haptic feedback is used in the app to indicate certain presses, and within the image viewer to indicate zoom limits are hit.
If haptic feedback is not desired in your application you can easily remove it by registering a different handler to the function.

```tsx
import { registerNativeHandlers } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

registerNativeHandlers({
  triggerHaptic: () => null,
});
```

This should be done outside of the component lifecycle to prevent unnecessarily re-registering the same handler repeatedly. 

## Handlers

There are 13 handlers registered as they interact with different native API packages depending on if the SDK being used on Expo or vanilla React Native.
