title: usePollAnswersPagination

A hook that queries answers for a given `Poll` and returns them in a paginated fashion. It can be used whenever we want to view all answers in a given `poll`, like in the [`PollAnswersList` component](../../ui-components/poll-answers-list.mdx) for example.

## Properties

### `paginationParams`

An object containing the pagination parameters that we may want to pass to the hook that will then be used to query for answers.

Its type can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts) under the name `PollAnswersQueryParams`.
