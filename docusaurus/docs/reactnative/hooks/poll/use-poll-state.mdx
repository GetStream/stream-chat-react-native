This is the hook containing most of the important properties from the `PollState`. It also provides several other utilities that make it easier to handle the UI for polls.

The full extent of the `Poll` state can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/poll.ts), under the `PollState` type. If the properties from the hook are not enough for rendering their desired UI, integrators are encouraged to write their own `selectors` and use the [`usePollStateStore`](./use-poll-state-store.mdx) hook instead.

This hook can only be used within a child of [`PollContext`](../../contexts/poll-context.mdx).

It is highly recommended that the user familiarizes themselves with the [`Poll` client documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/polls_api/?language=javascript&q=poll) in order to understand the properties better.
