  >
  ```

  - onLongPressMessage
  - onPressMessage
  - onPressInMessage
  - onDoubleTapMessage

  You will have access to payload of that handler as param:

      event, // any event object corresponding to touchable feedback
      emitter, // which component trigged this touchable feedback e.g. card, fileAttachment, gallery, message ... etc
      message // message object on which longPress occured
    }) => {
      /** Your custom action */
    }}

  - openCommandsPicker
  - openMentionsPicker
  - openFilePicker

- Value `typing` (which is list of users who are typing), has been moved from `ChannelContext` to its own separate context - `TypingContext` [c450719](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/c4507194956360ae27731fc81fed1d7dc1ed1861)


### Fixes

- [#522](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/issues/522) `initialValue` not being set for inputbox [63b3d79](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/572/commits/63b3d7995b30dccf23aece51cbc7479388890fd0)

##  [3.2.0] (2021-03-23)

###  **🛑 BREAKING**

- Minimum required `stream-chat` version is `3.5.1`.
- Following values have been moved from `MessagesContext` a separate context - `PaginatedMessageListContext`
  - hasMore
  - messages
  - loadMore
  - loadMoreRecent
  - loadMoreThread
  - loadingMore
  - loadingMoreRecent

### Non breaking:

#### Websocket and Push

From this release when app goes to background, websocket connection will be dropped by default.
This is necessary to allow push notifications.

We only send push notification, when user doesn't have any active websocket connection (which is established when you call `client.connectUser`). When your app goes to background, your device will keep the ws connection alive for around 15-20 seconds, and so within this period you won't receive any push notification. Until now, it was upto end user to drop the connection by explicitly calling `client.closeConnection()` or `client.wsConnection.disconnect()`, when app goes to background.
But from this release, we have moved this functionality to OOTB.

- If you don't have push system configured for your application, you can disable this functionality by adding a prop on Chat component - `closeConnectionOnBackground={false}`
- As described earlier, please make sure you are on `stream-chat >= 3.5.1`

#### Other

- Allow use of Channel component with uninitialized channel
- Allow custom config of i18next config
- UI fixes and animation improvements for reactions

## [3.1.2] (2021-03-17)

**NO CODE CHANGE**

Fixed version.json during package publishing, which we use to track the version of RN sdk through
`client.setUserAgent` call

## [3.1.1] (2021-03-17)

Fixed type definition pointers in package.json

- [Issue #560](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/issues/560)

## [3.1.0] (2021-03-15)

- **🛑 BREAKING**: Removed a prop `handleOnPress` on `Input` component.
- Added support for new props on `Input` component, which can be used on Channel component as prop to replace undelying input component ([reference](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Cookbook-v3.0#how-to-change-the-layout-of-messageinput-component))
    - closeAttachmentPicker (function)
    - openAttachmentPicker (function)
    - openCommandsPicker (function)
    - toggleAttachmentPicker (function)

- Added support for new prop on `Channel` component - `InputButtons`, to replace the extra buttons on the left on input box [#536](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/536)

- Added support for `messageActions` prop as callback. Also added support for prop `messageActions` on Channel component [#548](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/548)
  Earlier you could override messageActions prop as following:

  ```jsx
  <Channel
    messageActions=[
      {
        action: () => { /** Some message action logic */ };
        title: "Pin Message";
        icon: PinIcon;
        titleStyle: {};
      },
      {
        action: () => { /** Some message action logic */ };
        title: "Delete Message";
        icon: PinIcon;
        titleStyle: {};
      }
    ]
  >
    {/** MessageList and MessageInput component here */}
  </Channel>
  ```

  But now, you can selectly keep certain action and remove some:

  ```jsx
  /** Lets say you only want to keep threadReply and copyMessage actions */
  <Channel
    messageActions={({
      blockUser,
      copyMessage,
      deleteMessage,
      editMessage,
      flagMessage,
      muteUser,
      reply,
      retry,
      threadReply,
    }) => ([
      threadReply, copyMessage
    ])}
  >
    {/** MessageList and MessageInput component here */}
  </Channel>
  ```

## [3.0.0] (2021-02-23)

Version 3.x is a major revamp of the SDK and comes with **many breaking changes**. The new implementation takes advantage of React Context along with many popular community libraries such as Reanimated V2 to deliver a superior chat experience. **Upgrading will require re-implementing** your integration but will yield performance and functional benefits. It is highly recommended you read the Cookbook and examine the SampleApp / TypeScriptMessaging apps before upgrading to understand what is required.

### New features

  - Modern UX around reaction picker functionality, similar to iMessage
  - Inline replies
  - "Also send to channel" option on Threads
  - In app attachment picker
  - Improved avatars for grouped channels.
  - Rich image viewers with options to share the image outside the app, or view the image in gallery view.
  - "Copy Message" action as part of message actions.

### Improvements

- In previous versions, we did a lot of prop drilling throughout component trees, which makes it quite hard for end user to decide exactly where to set a particular prop. We have tried to centralize component customization on following three higher order components:

  - OverlayProvider
  - ChannelList
  - Channel

  We have prepared a visual guide to help you with component customizations - [Guide](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Cookbook-v3.0#custom-components)

- In v2.x.x, we decided to move away from class based components, towards functional components along with react hooks. React hooks are definitely a big addition to react eco-system, but when not careful it has potential to hammer the performance. We have handled all these issues as part of v3.0.0 using careful revamp around all the contexts and memoizations, which improves the app performance by a great margin.

- We have decided to abondon styled-components, are decided to have our own implementation

  - Removed dot notation for theming applications
  - Removed css string notation for styles on theme
  - Added displayName to components with bracket notation denoting the theme path e.g. `MessageStatus.displayName = 'MessageStatus{message{status}}';` indicates the theme path would be modified via `const customTheme: DeepPartial<Theme> = { message: { status: { ...customizations } } }`. Please check our [theme docs](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Cookbook-v3.0#theme) for more details.

### Note for Expo

- As of this release, expo is on version 40 which uses a version of React Native with a bug in the Dimensions API that occurs upon reloading an app in the simulator. Version 3.x uses relative sizing widely and depends on this API so issues will be visible in Expo until they update the custom React Native version they ship.

- [Android] As part of this release, we implemented a new feature - inline replies, similar to whatsapp. Bi-directional scrolling/pagination was necessary for this feature. To keep smooth scrolling experience, we implemented our [own solution](https://github.com/GetStream/flat-list-mvcp#maintainvisiblecontentposition-prop-support-for-android-react-native) for react-native. Although, Expo being close-source project, we can't do any such thing for Expo. So inline reply feature is not recommended to use in Expo, since you will not have a good scroll experience on Android, while scrolling down in message list.


## [2.2.2] 2021-02-07

## [2.0.0] 2020-10-29

Please check [Upgrade Docs](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Upgrade-helper#upgrade-from-0xx-to-2xx) for upgrading from 0.x.x to 2.x.x

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- You will need to install https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values and add this line `import 'react-native-get-random-values';` to your `index.js`
- Expo 39 is now the lowest supported version

### Typescript

This library has been moved to full typescript. Please check [Typescript doc](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Typescript-support) for details

### Component prop changes

*Channel*
- add `additionalKeyboardAvoidingViewProps` prop to allow custom keyboard props

*ChannelListMessenger*
- remove `setActiveChannel` prop

*ChannelPreviewMessenger*
- renamed the `latestMessage` prop to `latestMessagePreview`. This name change is more semantic to what the prop does and reduces confusion with the `lastMessage` prop

*MessageContent*
- removed `retrySendMessage` prop in favor of `retrySendMessage` within `MessagesContext`

*MessageInput*
- remove `parent` prop to `parent_id` as it needs to be just an id string instead of the entire parent object
- add `setInputRef` prop to actually allow forwarding of the TextInput ref controls

*MessageSystem*
- add `formatDate` prop to allow custom date formatting

*ChannelContext*

- We have split the `ChannelContext` into three separate contexts to further modularize the code and reduce renders as items in context change. The following contexts now contain the following values, previously all held within the `ChannelContext`:

  - `ChannelContext`:

    - `channel`
    - `disabled`
    - `EmptyStateIndicator`
    - `error`
    - `eventHistory`
    - `lastRead`
    - `loading`
    - `LoadingIndicator`
    - `markRead`
    - `members`
    - `read`
    - `setLastRead`
    - `typing`
    - `watcherCount`
    - `watchers`

  - `MessagesContext`

    - `Attachment`
    - `clearEditingState`
    - `editing`
    - `editMessage`
    - `emojiData`
    - `hasMore`
    - `loadingMore`
    - `loadMore`
    - `Message`
    - `messages`
    - `removeMessage`
    - `retrySendMessage`
    - `sendMessage`
    - `setEditingState`
    - `updateMessage`

  - `ThreadContext`

    - `closeThread`
    - `loadMoreThread`
    - `openThread`
    - `thread`
    - `threadHasMore`
    - `threadLoadingMore`
    - `threadMessages`

- All contexts are exported and any values can be accessed through a higher order component (ex: `withMessagesContext`) or with one of our custom context hooks (ex: access `MessagesContext` by `const { messages } = useMessagesContext();`).

## [1.3.5] 2020-10-27

- Fixing [keyboard issue](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/issues/397) during app state change [a8aa4ed](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/a8aa4edebd723120ea41d88b2f9d45df5a75f848)

## [1.3.4] 2020-10-13

## [1.3.2] 2020-10-02

- SuggestionsList (for user-mentions feature in MessageInput) doesn't update the position as per keyboard position. For the time being, we have fixed this by dismissing the suggestions list when keyboard gets dismissed  - [0fdff4f](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/0fdff4f327908d4b554b8d4172028e666df65242)

- Exported IconBadge and IconSquare components, to fix the tutorial [f1b6a39](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/f1b6a393930e7fcd1571d7d80b56937154454b47)

- Added file size to file attachment [7e653a4](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/7e653a4a302ba24e5f9b664d2fccba778084ed0b)

## [1.3.1] 2020-09-29

**No changes**

## [1.3.0] 2020-09-25

**BREAKING CHANGES**

## MessageInput

- Replaced the default image picker [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-image-picker) for [react-native-image-crop-picker](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker) and added `compressImageQuality` prop to support image compression out-of-the-box
- Added `FileUploadPreview` and `ImageUploadPreview` props to support custom overrides to those components

## KeyboardCompatibleView and Channel component

Implementation of internal KeyboardCompatibleView has been changed so as to make animations smoother and fix existing issues with keyboard behavior.
Support for following props have been dropped from Channel and KeyboardCompatibleView

- keyboardDismissAnimationDuration
- keyboardOpenAnimationDuration

Following new props have been introduced on `Channel` component. They are the same props accepted by KeyboardAvoidingView of react-native.

- keyboardBehavior ['height' | 'position' | 'padding']
- keyboardVerticalOffset


## ChannelList

- We converted the ChannelList component from a class to a function and abstracted the event listener logic into custom hooks. The default event handlers can still be overridden by providing custom prop functions to the ChannelList component. Custom logic can be provided for the following events:

  - `onAddedToChannel` overrides `notification.added_to_channel` default
  - `onChannelDeleted` overrides `channel.deleted` default
  - `onChannelHidden` overrides `channel.hidden` default
  - `onChannelTruncated` overrides `channel.truncated` default
  - `onChannelUpdated` overrides `channel.updated` default
  - `onMessageNew` overrides `notification.message_new` default
  - `onRemovedFromChannel` overrides `notification.removed_from_channel` default

- All custom event handlers now accept two arguments, with the `this` reference no longer needed in the functional component.

  - 1st argument: `setChannels` reference to the `useState` hook that sets the `channels` in the React Native FlatList
  - 2nd argument: `event` object returned by the StreamChat instance

e.g.,

```js
// In following example we will override the default handler for notification.added_to_channel
<ChannelList
  filters={}
  onAddedToChannel={(setChannels, event) => {
    setChannels(channels => {
      // Do additional actions on channels array.
      return channels;
    })
  }}
>
```
- On upgrading to this release, ensure events and any custom handling functions (ex: `onAddedToChannel` or `onMessageNew`) are properly processed and update the list UI as expected.

## FileUploadPreview

- We fixed a bug for being unable to remove a file from the `MessageInput` and made it consistent to `ImageUploadPreview`
- We have removed support for the `fileUploadPreview.dismissText` theme value
- We have added support for `fileUploadPreview.dismiss`, `fileUploadPreview.dismissImage`, and `fileUploadPreview.imageContainer` theme values

## MessageInput

- We replaced the default image picker [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-image-picker) for [react-native-image-crop-picker](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker) and added `compressImageQuality` prop to support image compression out-of-the-box
- Added `FileUploadPreview` and `ImageUploadPreview` props to support custom overrides to those components

## MessageSystem

- Added `formatDate` prop to support custom date formatting

## Deprecated Props

- We have removed support for the `MessageList` component's `onMessageTouch` prop. Please use the `onPress` prop on the `MessageSimple` component to perform an action on touch of a message.

- We have removed support for the `Message` component's `readOnly` prop. Please use the `disabled` value from the `ChannelContext` instead.

- We renamed the `latestMessage` prop on the `ChannelPreviewMessenger` component to `latestMessagePreview`. This name change is more semantic to what the prop does and reduces confusion with the `lastMessage` prop.

- We have also dropped support for the following `MessageList` props:
  - `dateSeparator` (use DateSeparator instead)
  - `headerComponent` (use HeaderComponent instead)

## this Reference Removal

- We have removed the `this` class component reference from the prop functions in `MessageSimple`. For example, if you wish to override the SDK's standard long press behavior on a message, the `onLongPress` function passed in to `MessageSimple` no longer takes the `this` component reference as it's first argument. The message and the event object become the first and second arguments, respectively.

## renderText Function

- The `renderText` function utilized in the `MessageTextContainer` component now accepts a single object containing `markdownRules`, `markdownStyles`, and `message`. Previously each value was a separate function parameter.

## [1.2.0] 2020-08-21

**NO BREAKING CHANGES**

- Following components have been converted to functional component from class based component.

  - Chat
  - KeyboardCompatibleView
  - SuggestionsProvider
  - AutoCompleteInput
  - Spinner

- So far we exported bundled/transpiled version of components from package as single file - dist/index.js, dist/index.es using rollup. But now we are moving away from this approach and instead distributing original source of components since react-native handles bundling/transpiling part anyways. This also makes it easy for end-users to debug components exported from stream-chat-react-native.

## [1.1.1] 2020-08-03

- Fixed [#270](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/issues/270) - [8ec70bd](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/273/commits/8ec70bdd2bae4f03c595466ba60d247c44f4c474)

- Upgraded `@testing-library/react-native` to v7 [4c687b4](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/4c687b48d689abb97ba00228224169d70c245076)

## [1.1.0] 2020-07-31

- Fixed exports of MessageStatus, MessageContent, MessageAvatar, MessageTextContainer components [#268](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/pull/268)

- Moving following components to functional components

  - ChannelPreview
  - ChannelPreviewMessenger
  - Attachment
  - Card
  - FileAttachment
  - EmptyStateIndicator, LoadingIndicator, LoadingErrorIndicator

- Decoupled actionsheet from MessageInput component [59618ad](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/59618adbc238763cf7fd3d5ba3dd0304012877de)

## [1.0.0] 2020-07-29

We've already been on a v1 release for a while but never updated our versioning. Right now we're in the process of rewriting our components to be more future proof and we started using hooks, hence the v1.0.0 today.

Breaking change: stream-chat-react-native now relies on hooks and will need react-native >= 0.59.0 to work

Rewrite will involve following changes:

1. Functional components instead of class based components
2. Static typing using typescript
3. UI tests

We are going to incrementally implement these changes and will try to keep everything backwards compatible unless really necessary.

## [0.15.2] 2020-07-29

- Exporting `AutoCompleteInput` component [d41d0d5](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/d41d0d58ce02556cedf1825a2adb6a5c366a770c)

  It fixes the issue with markdown where text like "#stream" was treated as heading, thus disallowing anyone to use hashtags in chat.

- Internal directory restructuring of components

## [0.14.0] 2020-07-16

- Fixing compatibility issues with react-native 0.63 [88721a0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/88721a077b3bb3369c3d8dbde9451d84f6761d87)
- Updating stream-chat to 0.13.x [4af1b1d](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/4af1b1d63a3c7dec662f8c75426ea7a7082f26a4)

## [0.13.1] 2020-07-14

- [84ded29](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/84ded29bf7afd9e9e5178e76e79953d8b27dc77c) Bug fix - **Only** set active channel in ChannelList component on complete reload, which happens in following cases:

  - first load on chat
  - changes in filters

## [0.13.0] 2020-07-08

- Upgrading `@stream-io/react-native-simple-markdown` to 1.2.0. It fixes markdown related issues regarding line breaks
- Added a new prop to the MessageInput component - `sendImageAsync`. It’s value defaults to false, but when set to true, if the user hits send on a message before an attached image has finished uploading, the message text will be sent immediately and the image will be sent as a follow-up message as soon as a successful response has been received by the CDN [455571d](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/455571d68db5e617882b59a81e15f934f0365952)
- Fixed typescript for isMyMessage function [7d55134](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/7d5513479e55b014562b7d07082628f4215e4a92)

## [0.12.4] 2020-06-30

- Improving MessageInput component, to better handle the case of rapid typing [3fddf06](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/3fddf06426cce5a9cc8dad1e80f9dec1efb4751d)
- Fixing fallback avatar for MentionsItem component [159fcb8](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/159fcb856171eaa1f0e2f57f5e9442177eb10b88)

## [0.12.3 2020-06-17

- Fixing `enabled` prop on KeyboardCompatibleView

## [0.12.2] 2020-06-17

- Fixing broken file upload functionality on android [2cb26e7](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/2cb26e7951e2030f1c319ad82c55bf0273ef6532)

## [0.12.1] 2020-06-16

- Allow search for special characters in mentions autocomplete [a2cb083](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/commit/a2cb083a3d6657b5c3a122fcd5843d0c9f51a5a6)

## [0.12.0] 2020-06-15

- **Improvements to autocomplete feature in MessageInput component**.

Until now if your channel had more than 100 members, then you couldn't see members (besides first 100) in mentions popup box. This was because queryChannels api only populates 100 members in channel state and mentions feature was based on searching for members in channel state.

From now on, autocomplete input (specifically mentions autocomplete) will be api based search. So that mentions feature will work even for the channels with more than 100 members.

## [0.11.0] 2020-06-01

**Non breaking changes**

### UX improvements of ChannelList component

  <div style="display: inline">
    <img src="./screenshots/7.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="250" border="1" style="margin-right: 30px" />
    <img src="./screenshots/8.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="250" border="1" style="margin-right: 30px" />
    <img src="./screenshots/9.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="250" border="1" />
  </div>

  - So far we only had `LoadingErrorIndicator` (which can be customized using prop `LoadingErrorIndicator`). This error indicator replaces the entire channel
  list on screen. So if your 2nd page of list results in error, we used to remove all the already fetched channels and show this full screen error indicator.
  Instead we have introduced following error indicators, which will be displayed at top of the list in case or error. Please note that if first page of
  queryChannels api results in error, we will display LoadingErrorIndicator

    - HeaderErrorIndicator
    - HeaderNetworkDownIndicator

  - Introducing following new props to ChannelList component

    - `FooterLoadingIndicator` {UI Component} To override default spinner at footer of channel list (introduced in this release)
    - `HeaderErrorIndicator` {UI Component} To override default HeaderErrorIndicator
    - `HeaderNetworkDownIndicator`{UI Component} To override default HeaderNetworkDownIndicator

  - Introduced pull to refresh functionality, to refresh the ChannelList in case of failure.
  - Adding following prop to `LoadingErrorIndicator`

    - `retry` {func} If you are using custom `LoadingErrorIndicator` for your ChannelList component, you can attach this function to CTA button
    to reload the ChannelList.

  - Added retry mechanism to ChannelList's queryChannels api call. In case of failure, api will be retried 3 times (max) at the interval of 2 seconds.

## [0.10.3] 2020-05-15

### Prop changes to components (non-breaking)

- MessageSimple

  **new props**

  - `MessageReplies` UI component to override default `2 replies` text/component
  - `MessageHeader` UI component to add some content on top of message content (text, attachments)
  - `ReactionList` UI component to override default ReactionList component
  - `supportedReactions` Array of reactions which should be available or supported in reaction picker. [Example](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/vishal/docs-improvement/docs/cookbook.md#message-with-custom-reactions)

  **deprecated props**

  - `emojiDate` Please use supportedReactions instead

- MessageAvatar

  **new props**

  - `alignment` ('right' | 'left')

- MessageContent

  **new props**

  - All the new props to MessageSimple are available in MessageContent
  - `alignment` ('right' | 'left')

- ReactionPickerWrapper

  In previous version, you could open reaction picker only after clicking/pressing `ReactionList`, which made it hard to change the
  functionality of `ReactionList` without copy pasting lots of code regarding opening of `ReactionPicker`. And also ReactionPicker
  logic was tightly coupled with MessageContent component (which meant added complexity)
  With ReactionPickerWrapper, we are taking out all the ReactionPicker related logic (setting the position of reaction picker
  at message which was touched) from MessageContent. So you can now add _open reaction picker on press_ functionality
  on any component that you wish. You just need to wrap your component with `ReactionPickerWrapper` component.

  You can also adjust the relative position at which ReactionPicker opens up or shows up by altering `offset`
  prop on ReactionPickerWrapper.

  Default value is:

  ```
  {
      top: 40,
      left: 30,
      right: 10,
  }
  ```

  NOTE: This component was present in repository in previous versions as well, but it was super buggy.

  **TL;DR** Enables you to build custom ReactionList, on touch of which, ReactionPicker will open up

  Please check this example from cookbook for details - https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/vishal/docs-improvement/docs/cookbook.md#message-bubble-with-reactions-at-bottom-of-message

- Channel

  - Update the component, when `channel` prop changes.
